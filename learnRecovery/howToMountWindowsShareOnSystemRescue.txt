How to access a Share on a Windows computer with CIFS
-----------------------------------------------------
SystemRescueCd comes with the smbfs/cifs client package that allows you to connect to a Windows machine having shared drives. In recent kernels, support for smbfs has been replaced with cifs so you should try not to use smbfs.

The mount-cifs package allows you to access a Windows computer on the network. Here is an example to explain how to access Windows shared folders. Let's consider the Windows box is on 192.168.10.3 and has a shared directory called mydata accessible by the user called robert:

mkdir /mnt/windows
mount -t cifs //192.168.10.3/mydata /mnt/windows -o username=robert,password=root
cd /mnt/windows

Now you should be able to see files in /mnt/windows. Don't forget to unmount the directory when you have finished what you are doing in the shared directory.

umount /mnt/windows



How to mount local Windows 
--------------------------
mkdir -p /mnt/localWindows
mount -t ntfs  /dev/sda1   /mnt/localWindows    # If this does not work, try /dev/sda2
