Lesson:  Differences between ng-model and ng-bind
-------------------------------------------------
ng-model employs 2-way binding
ng-bind  employs 1-way binding


The ng-model directive employs two-way binding
----------------------------------------------
  -- if you make any update on the field, then it should reflect in variable 
  -- if there is any change in the variable then that should reflect in the field
   
   
   In this example, typing-in the textbox will cause {{ctrl.username}} to change in real-time
      <input type="text" ng-model="ctrl.username"/><br/>
      You typed {{ctrl.username}}

   

The ng-bind directive employes one-way binding
----------------------------------------------
The ng-bind directive employes one-way data binding used for displaying the value inside html component as inner HTML. 
This directive is very useful for updating the blocks like div, span, etc. with inner HTML content.
 
    In this example, typing-in the textbox will be *initialized* with the value found in ctrl.username
    NOTE:  Changes to the textbox will not be updated in ctrl.username
   
     <input type="text" ng-bind="ctrl.username"/><br/>
      You typed {{ctrl.username}}

    

NOTE:  The {{ }} also employes one-way binding
