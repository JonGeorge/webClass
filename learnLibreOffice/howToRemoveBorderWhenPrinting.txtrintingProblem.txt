How to Remove the Blank Border that appears when Printing w/LibreOffice Writer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I have a word document that has a background image and I want to print it 
          The print preview shows no border
          The hard-copy print out has an extra border
          

Solution: Tell your print driver to print borderless
-----------------------------------------------------
 1. Startup Libre Writer 
 2. Pull File / Printer Settings
 3. In the "Printer Setup" popup
    -- Select your printer
    -- Click Properties
 4. In the Propertie sbox
    -- Set Paper Size to Letter(borderless)
    -- Press OK
    -- Press OK
 5. Pull File / Print
 6. In the Print popup, select the "Options" tab
 7. In the "Options" tab
    Check "Use only paper size from printer preferences"
    Press OK
    
    -- Now, your print-out will not have any border
