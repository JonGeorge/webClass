How to Setup Wake-up On LAN
---------------------------
Wake-up on LAN means that you can send a packet to a computer [that is connected to the network by RJ45] and 
that packet will cause the ethernet card to tell the computer to startup.  So, your computer can be turned-off
during the day, but easily turned-on from a 2nd computer [such as a laptop]


Procedures 
----------
 1. On the desktop that you want to wake-up
    a. Get the MAC address of the ethernet card
    b. Set the properties of your ethernet card so that WOL is turned-on
    c. Make sure this ethernet card is connected to your LAN
    
    
    
 2. On the remote computer that will send the packet:
    a. Install Perl
    b. Copy the wake.pl program to your c:\vault\wakeDesktop\ directory
    c. Create a wakeDesktop.bat script and copy this to it:
       NOTE:  Replace "AB:CD:EF:12:34:45" with the MAC address of the ethernet card of the computer that will wake-up
       
        @echo off
        cd /d C:\vault\wakeDesktop


        REM ** Wakeup my desktop **
        perl wake.pl "AB:CD:EF:12:34:45"
    
    
 3. Try it
    a. Turn off the desktop
    b. Run the wakeDesktop.bat script 
       -- Your desktop should startup
