How to Expand Storage of Samsung S4
-----------------------------------
Tricia's Samsung S4 had a small 8 GB SD card.  I bought a bigger 64 GB SD card.  

Here's how to add storage without losing anything

Assumptions:
 A) Your desktop computer has a slot to read the SD Card
 


Procedure
---------
 1. Open-up your Samsung S4
 2. Copy all files from nearly-full 8 GB SD Card to your computer:
    a. Pull-out the 8 GB SD card from S4
    b. Insert the SD card into an adapter
    c. Insert the adapter-with-card into your computer
	     NOTE:  I assume that your card is mapped to the drive letter H:
	   
    d. Copy all of the files (and hidden files) from you SD card to your c:\sd-card\
	     1) Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
	        CMD> cd /
	        CMD> mkdir c:\sd-card
	        CMD> cd c:\sd-card
	        CMD> xcopy H:\"*.*" /s /e /v /h
  
	        W A I T     A N     H O U R
  
    e. Eject the card from your computer
	
	
 3. Format your new, bigger SD Card
    a. Insert the newer-bigger SD card into your phone
    b. Go to Storage
    c. Format SD Card
    d. Unmount SD Card
    e. Pull the bigger SD card out of your S4
	

 4. Copy the old files from your old card to your bigger SD card
    a. Insert the bigger SD card into the adapter
    b. Insert the card-and-adapter into your computer
   	   NOTE:  I assume that your card is mapped to the drive letter H:
	   
    c. Copy all of the files (and hidden files) from c:\sd-card\ to your newer, bigger SD card
	     1) Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
	        CMD> cd /d H:\
	        CMD> xcopy c:\sd-card\"*.*" /s /e /v /h

	        W A I T     A N     H O U R
  
	  
 5. Insert the newer SD card into your phone

 6. Tell the Application Manager to use SD-card
    a. Press Settings -> "More" tab
    b. Select Application Manager	
    c. Look for apps under "SD Card"
	     1) Click on each one
	     2) Press "Move to SD Card"
	        -- Wait for it to finish
	 
	     3) Repeat for the other apps
