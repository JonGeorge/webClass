How annotations select the right implementation?
------------------------------------------------
When using @Autowired and @Inject
 1) Matches by Type
 2) Restricts by Qualifiers
 3) Matches by Name

When using @Resource
 1) Matches by Name
 2) Matches by Type
 3) Restricts by Qualifiers (ignored if match is found by name)


WARNING:  Spring has a fall back to use by-type
-----------------------------------------------
The Spring-Implementation of @Resource has a built-in fallback, which kicks in when resolution by-name fails. 
In this case, it falls back to the @Autowired-kind resolution by-type. 
While this fallback is convenient, IMHO it causes a lot of confusion, because people are unaware of the conceptual difference and tend to use @Resource for type-based autowiring.

Best Approach
-------------
 A) Explicitly name your component [@Component("beanName")]
 B) Use @Resource with the name attribute [@Resource(name="beanName")]
