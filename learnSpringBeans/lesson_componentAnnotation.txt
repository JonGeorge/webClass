Lesson:  Component Annotation
-----------------------------

The @Component annotation flags a bean so the component-scannign mechanism can pull it into the Spring application context


Changes to your application-context.xml
---------------------------------------
 1) You would not need to declare a bean in your application-context.xml
    So, put @Component on top of a public class and you do not need to include it in your application-context.xml file.

 2) You need to turn on component scanning
   
      <context:component-scan base-package="com.something"/>
      
      NOTE:  When component-scan is declared, you do *NOT* need to declare context:annotation-confic 
             this is because autowiring is implicity enabled when component scanning is enabled
