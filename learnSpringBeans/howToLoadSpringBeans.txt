How to manually load spring beans

How to automatically load spring beans
--------------------------------------
Part 1: In your applicationContext.xml file

  <!-- Auto load all@Component annotated objects -->
   <context:component-scan base-package="app1" />
   
   
Part 2: Put @Component on your class definition


package app1.services

@Componenet
public class myProvider 
{
   // my class will be a spring bean
}


The end result is that this class will be a Spring Bean and by default a singleton

NOTE:  
  1) Spring beans are all in singleton scope by default. 
  2) The only thing you have to have in mind is that you should *not* store state in field variables
      (they should only hold dependencies). 
  3) Thus your application will be thread-safe, and you want require a new instance of a bean each time. 
     In other words, your beans are stateless.
