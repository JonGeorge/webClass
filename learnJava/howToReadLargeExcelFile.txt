How to Read a Large Excel Files Using excel-stremaing-reader
------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  The older Apache POI library reads the entire Excel file into memory (it's not memory efficient)
          But, I want to process a large Excel file *without* reading the entire thing into memory


Approach:  Use the excel-streaming-reader 
           NOTE:  This library will ONLY work with XLSX files. The older XLS format is not capable of being streamed.
           

// Part 1:  Open the file using the Stremaing Reader
InputStream is = new FileInputStream(new File("/path/to/workbook.xlsx"));
Workbook workbook = StreamingReader.builder()
        .rowCacheSize(100)    // number of rows to keep in memory (defaults to 10)
        .bufferSize(4096)     // buffer size to use when reading InputStream to file (defaults to 1024)
        .open(is);            // InputStream or File for XLSX file (required)

// Part 2:  Loop through the rows and cells
for (Sheet sheet : workbook){
  System.out.println(sheet.getSheetName());
  for (Row r : sheet) {
    for (Cell c : r) {
      System.out.println(c.getStringCellValue());
    }
  }
}

// Or open a sheet by name or index:
Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheet("My Sheet")



Procedure
---------
 1. Add this dependency to your java project
     <dependency>
      <groupId>com.monitorjbl</groupId>
      <artifactId>xlsx-streamer</artifactId>
      <version>2.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
  
 
 2. Create a command-line java program that will read a file
 
 
 3.
