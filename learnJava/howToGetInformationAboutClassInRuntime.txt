How to Get Information about Java Class in Run-Time
---------------------------------------------------

Problem:  You are getting strange java errors and you think the class you are loading is not the right version.
          How do you get information about a class *AT* run-time?
          
Solution: Use the class loader


Example Java Code
-----------------
ClassLoader classLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
URL resource = classLoader.getResources("com/mysql/jdbc/Driver.class");
logger.debug(com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.class info is {}", resource.toString());

-- It should show you the actual java JAR file being used, and the class
-- So, you can see which version of the class you are using.
