How to Setup Tunnel (using unix shell)
--------------------------------------
Problem:  You need to connect to a database server listening on 192.168.90.8:5432
          And, the database would not let you connect from your own box
          
Solution: Setup a tunnel such that localhost:5001 connects to 192.168.90.8:5432
          So, the database server thinks you are on the same box as the database server
          

# Setup a tunnel so that localhost:5001 --> 192.168.90.8:5432
# NOTE: The -N says to not create a unix shell
unix> ssh -N -L  ssh -N -L 5001:192.168.90.8:5432 admin@192.168.90.8
