How to Prevent SSH Session from Timing Out (using Putty)
--------------------------------------------------------

Problem:  You use putty to connect to a unix server
          But, your unix sessions keep timing-out after a few minutes
          
Solution: Tell Putty to send "keep-alive" packets to your destination unix server
 1. Run Putty 
 2. Select your session
 3. Click on Connection
    Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off):  Set it to 60
 4. Click on Session
 5. Click "Save"
 
Even better:  Apply this change to the "Default Settings"
