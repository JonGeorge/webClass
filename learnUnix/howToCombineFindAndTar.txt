How to Combine the Find and Tar Commands
----------------------------------------

Problem:  I want to tar all of the yaml files found in a directory (and all sub directories)
Solution: Combine find and tar

Procedure
---------
 unix> cd /path/to/where/yaml/files/are
 unix> find . -iname '*.yaml' -exec tar rvf /tmp/stuff.tar {} \;
 
 -- Now, you should have a tar file called /tmp/stuff.tar
