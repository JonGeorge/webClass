Identify where RPM installed the executable
-------------------------------------------
Problem:  You just did a yum install but you do not know where the executable is

Solution: Use rpm -ql <package-name>


Example
-------
 unix> sudo yum install qalculate   # To install calculator
 unix> sudo rpm -ql  qalculate
       /usr/bin/qalc

  So, the calculator was installeed to /usr/bin/qalc
