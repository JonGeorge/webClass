How to Understand CPU Percentage in Top
---------------------------------------

The unix command called 'top' provided CPU percentage.

Sometimes, it will show a CPU percentage that is greater than 100%.

The nproc command will tell you how many cores.  If your box has 24 cores, then a single program can use 2400%

Procedure
---------
unix> nproc
      8
       
      -- Means that this unix server has 8 cores
      
unix> top

     press 1 to see a breakdown of cores
