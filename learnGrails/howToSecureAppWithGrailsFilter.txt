To create a filter, create a class that ends with the convention Filters in the grails-app/conf directory. Within this class define a code block called filters that contains the filter definitions. Within the filters there are three types of interceptors: before - executed before action, after - executed after action, afterView - executed after rendering the view. Here is an example of applying different filters. 

Procedure
---------
 1. To create a Grails filter,
    DOS> cd c:\tools\intellij\workspace\grailsWebAppR
    DOS> grails create-filter SecurityFilters
    
    
 2. Add logging to the SecurityFilters class
 
        package grailswebappr
        
        import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory
        import org.slf4j.Logger
        
        class SecurityFilters
        {
            private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SecurityFilters.class)
        
            def filters = {
                all(controller:'*', action:'*') {
                    before = {
                        logger.debug("Calling all.before()")
                    }
                    after = { Map model ->
                        logger.debug("Calling all.after()")
                    }
                    afterView = { Exception e ->
                        logger.debug("Calling all.afterView()")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
