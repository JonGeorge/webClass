In this situation, I am going to simulate a 4 page web flow
   Page 1:  Ask user what stock symbol to buy
   Page 2:  Ask user how many shares and what price
   Page 3:  Ask user to confirm the order
   Page 4:  Tell user that the order has been submitted

Each page has the option of going back or forward
