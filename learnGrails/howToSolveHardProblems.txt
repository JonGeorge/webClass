How to Solve Hard Problems in Grails
------------------------------------

1. Problem:  You get a problem with session factory but the real error is 
             Caused by: org.hibernate.MappingException: Association references unmapped class: java.util.List

   Solution:  Look at your Domain objects.  You probably have a List of some object.
   
   How to find hints:
      log4j = {
              ...
          debug  'org.codehaus.groovy.grails.orm.hibernate.cfg'
      }
