Search Page Design Approach #1:  Open Results in a new Browser Tab
------------------------------------------------------------------

Your search box is in one page
Clicking "Search" causes a new tab to open.
+ User can go back to the search form by clicking on the old tab [because the tab is still there]
- Could generate lots of tabs [if there are lots of results]
