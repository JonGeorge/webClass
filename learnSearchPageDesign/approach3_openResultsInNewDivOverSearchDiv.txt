Search Page Design Approach #3: Open the Results in a new Div that goes over the Search div
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approach
--------
The user has lots of search criteria and presses "Search"
The results page *looks* like a new page, but it's an AJAX call that causes a results div to appear over it
The user then clicks on a link that takes them back to the "Search" page [causing the results div to hide and search page to show]

+ Works well when there are *LOTS* of search criteria
+ Works well when user wants to use the full page to show search criteria


Even better:  Put a vertical bar to the left that says "Search Form" or "Results" 
that lets users quickly go back and forth between the last results and the search form.
