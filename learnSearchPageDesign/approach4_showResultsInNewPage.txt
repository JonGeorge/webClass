Approach #4:  Show Results in a New Page
----------------------------------------

Approach
--------
This is the traditional search page has little or lots of criteria.
The user enters the criteria and presses search
The form submit is executed
A setTimeout causes the spinner href to be refreshed (causing the spinner to appear while the form submit is running)
A new page appears with the result


+ Simple to implement [no ajax needed]
- User must click back button to get to the search page  [which probably will not have original criteria -- but will have empty boxes]
+ The results page can use the full criteria


Improvement on this approach:  Use this approach with a Search History page
  -- So, each search has the option of being saved for the user or all users to see
  -- Users can then use this Search History page to go back to older queries
