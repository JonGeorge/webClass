Search Page Design Approach #2:  Show Results Beneath Search Box
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this situation, the user presses "Search" and the results appear on the *same* page
+ The user's search criteria is visible with the results
+ It's easy to tweak the search criteria [as it is on the same page]
- If you have lots of search options, then you don't have much space for results
  [doesn't work so well for the crazy complicated advanced search page]
  
  
This approach works well with few search criteria
