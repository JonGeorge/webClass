Validation Approach #1:  Use Colors to Highlight Missing Fields
---------------------------------------------------------------

When the user presses "Search", highlight the required fields in bright red background

People notice icons 1st, colors 2nd, and words 3rd.
By, putting a color on the missing fields, you make it obvious what is wrong.

for example, background-color: #ff6663
             color: #ffffdd
