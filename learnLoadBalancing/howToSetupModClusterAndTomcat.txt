How to Setup Mod_cluster to Load Balance Tomcat Web Apps
--------------------------------------------------------
Mod_cluster is an apache httpd-based load balancer that uses a communication channel to forward requests 
from apache-httpd to a set of application server nodes.  And, each application server nodes holds an app server -- e.g., Tomcat

Unlike mod_jk and mod_proxy, mod_cluster utilizes an additional connection between the application server nodes and httpd. 
The application server nodes use this connection to send server-side load balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd via the Mod-Cluster Management Protocol (MCMP), 
a custom set of HTTP methods. With this additional feedback channel, mod_cluster can provide more intelligence and 
granularity than many other load-balancing alternatives.  This provides the following advantages:
 a) Dynamic configuration of httpd workers
 b) Server-side load balance factor calculation
 c) Fine-grained Web app lifecycle control
 d) AJP is optional

Assumption
 A) You have a Java Web App that you want to run on *multiple* Tomcat instances
 B) You are running Apache httpd on Windows
 

There are a few approaches:
  Approach #1) Download an apache httpd that has the mod-cluster modules
  Approach #2) Add the mod-cluster modules to your existing apache httpd

 

                



A P P R O A C H    #1:  Download an apache httpd daemon that has the mod-cluster modules with it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Download and install the httpd binaries with mod-cluster
    a. Go to http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/downloads
    b. Click on "mod_cluster 1.3.1 Final bin downloads"
       or 
       http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/mod_cluster/downloads/1-3-1-Final-bin
       
       
       -- You want to download the mod_cluster native bundles with httpd and openssl (mod_cluster-1.2.6.Final)
          or 
          32-bit Windows:  http://downloads.jboss.org/mod_cluster//1.3.1.Final/windows/mod_cluster-1.3.1.Final-windows-x86-ssl.zip 
          64-bit Windows:  http://downloads.jboss.org/mod_cluster//1.3.1.Final/windows/mod_cluster-1.3.1.Final-windows-amd64-ssl.zip            
    b. Save mod_cluster-1.3.1.Final-windows-x86-ssl.zip to your c:\vault
    
    c. Right-click on c:\vaultmod_cluster-1.3.1.Final-windows-x86-ssl.zip -> 7-zip -> Extract Files...
       In the "Extract to" box, type-in c:\tools
    
        -- You should have these directories:
              C:\tools\httpd-2.4\bin\
              C:\tools\httpd-2.4\cgi-bin\
              C:\tools\httpd-2.4\conf
              
        This is an apache httpd-2.4 installation with the mod-cluster binaries compiled in
        
        
    e. Open a DOS window in *ADMINISTRATOR* mode
       DOS> cd /d c:\tools\httpd-2.4\bin
       DOS> installconf.bat
            NOTE:  Now, you have a httpd.conf file
                   Now, your default apache httpd is listening on port 8000
            
     
    f. Verify that the apache httpd daemon runs on windows    
       1) Attempt to start httpd
          a) Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
          b) DOS> cd /d c:\tools\httpd-2.4\bin
             DOS> httpd.exe
             
       3) Attempt to connect to it
          a) Open a web browser
          b) Connecto http://localhost:8000/
             -- You should see "It works"
    
       4) Kill the Ctrl-C in the DOS window to stop running httpd.exe
       
        
    g. Setup Apache 2.4 to run as a Windows Service
       1) Open a DOS Window as an *ADMINISTRATOR* by press <Start><Run>CMD   (but do not press enter)
          NOTE:  Right-click on "Command Prompt" -> Run as Administrator
           
       2) DOS> cd /d c:\tools\Apache24\bin
          DOS> httpd -k install
           
          Installing the 'Apache2.4' service
          The 'Apache2.4' service is successfully installed.
          Testing httpd.conf....
          Errors reported here must be corrected before the service can be started.
           
       3) Run the service
          a) Press <Start><Run>Services.msc
          b) Right-click on "Apache2.4" -> Start
          c) Verify that it is running by
             1) Open a web browser
             2) Connect to http://localhost:8000/
                -- You should see the "It works" page
          
          
         NOTE:  To delete this windows service, run this command
           a) Open a DOS window (as *ADMINISTRATOR*)
           b) DOS> sc delete Apache2.4
                [SC] DeleteService SUCCESS          
            
    
 
 2. Configure apache httpd to use activate ssl
    a. Edit the httpd.conf file
       It should be here:  c:\tools\httpd-2.4\conf\httpd.conf
      
       Uncomment this line
         LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
      
    b. Restart the Apache 2.4 service
    
    c. Look at the C:\tools\httpd-2.4\logs\error_log
       You should see what version of OpenSSL was compiled0in to the mod_ssl.so file
       
       [Sat Oct 10 21:35:14.899584 2015] [mpm_winnt:notice] [pid 5628:tid 488] AH00455: Apache/2.4.10 (Win64) OpenSSL/0.9.8r mod_cluster/1.3.1.Final configured -- resuming normal operations

  
  
 3. Verify that mod-cluster is running
    Look at the mod-cluster manager status page:
      http://localhost:6666/mod_cluster_manager
    
    
    
 4. Download Tomcat   [see howToSetupTomcat8.txt]
 
 
 
 5. Setup Tomcat #1
    a. Download the mod-cluster jar files
       1) Download the mod-cluster server-side binaries for Tomcat
          Go to http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/mod_cluster/downloads/1-3-1-Final-bin
          Click on java budles for JBoss AS, Tomcat...
          or
          http://downloads.jboss.org/mod_cluster//1.3.1.Final/linux-x86_64/mod_cluster-parent-1.3.1.Final-bin.tar.gz
       
       2) Save mod_cluster-parent-1.3.1.Final-bin.tar.gz to your c:\vault\ 
       
       3) Right-click on c:\vault\mod_cluster-parent-1.3.1.Final-bin.tar.gz -> 7zip -> Extract Here
       4) Right-click on c:\vault\mod_cluster-parent-1.3.1.Final-bin.tar -> 7zip -> Extract Files
          Extract to:  c:\tools\mod-cluster-server-side-binaries
          
          You should now have this directory
 
              c:\tools\mod-cluster-server-side-binaries\JBossWeb-Tomcat\lib


    b. Install the mod-cluster jar files to Tomcat #1's <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib
       a) Copy all of the jars found in 
              c:\tools\mod-cluster-server-side-binaries\JBossWeb-Tomcat\lib
          To your
              <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib

       b) Delete the Tomcat-versioned jar files that you are not using:
         If you are running Tomcat7, then
            delete <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib/mod_cluster-container-tomcat6-1.3.1.Final.jar
            delete <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib/mod_cluster-container-tomcat8-1.3.1.Final.jar
       
         If you are running Tomcat8, then
            delete <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib/mod_cluster-container-tomcat6-1.3.1.Final.jar
            delete <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib/mod_cluster-container-tomcat7-1.3.1.Final.jar     
               
    
          
    c. Configure Tomcat #1 to talk with mod_cluster
       a) Edit your <TOMCAT-HOME>/conf/server.xml
       
          Add this to it
     
            <Listener className="org.jboss.modcluster.container.catalina.standalone.ModClusterListener" advertise="true"/>
    
    d. Restart Tomcat #1
    
    
 
 6. Deploy a sample web app to Tomcat #1
 
 
 7. Setup Tomcat #2
 
 8. Deploy a sample web app to Tomcat #2
 
 9. Verify that mod-cluster recognizes both Tomcats
