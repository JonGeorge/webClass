Lesson:  Converting XML to JSON requires rules
----------------------------------------------

If you have XML and you want to convert it to JSON, then you need rules to handle these cases:
 1) Problem Case #1:  Empty XML tag  <stuff></stuff>
    -- Does this get converted to an empty string?
    -- Does this get converted to an empty object?
    -- Does this get converted to an empty list?
    
    
 2) Problem Case #2:  Missing XML tags
    Suppose your XML string is supoosed to contain <food>...</food>, but does not have it
    -- Does this get converted at all [in the JSON]?
    -- Does this get converted to an empty food object in JSON?
    

The only way to reliably convert XML to json is to have a list of rules to handle these cases
