Lesson:  Change form validation from template-driven to model-based
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The previous form validation lessons relies on HTML elements and attributes 
to define the fields that make up the form.  

Pros & Cons of template-driven form validation
+ It's familiar
+ It's simple
- For large forms, it becomes complex
- For large forms, it becomes hard to maintain

Pros & Cons of model-based form validation
+ Easier to maintain for complex forms
- It requires more typescript code


Procedure
---------
 1. Add the AddReportFormControl typescript class
    a. Right-click on frontend/src/app/reports/add-report -> New File:
       Filename:  add-report.form.control.ts
       
    b. Copy this to the newly-created file:
        import {FormControl, FormGroup} from "@angular/forms";

        export class AddReportFormControl extends FormControl {
          label: string;
          modelProperty: string;

          constructor(aLabel: string, aModelProperty: string, aValue: any, aValidator: any) {
            super(aValue, aValidator);

            this.label = aLabel;
            this.modelProperty = aModelProperty
          }
        }


 2. Add the AddReportFormGroup typescrpit class
    a. Right-click on frontend/src/app/reports/add-report -> New File:
       Filename:  add-report.form.group.ts
  
    b. Copy this to the newly-created file:
        import {FormGroup, Validators} from "@angular/forms";
        import {AddReportFormControl} from "./add-report.form.model";

        export class AddReportFormGroup extends FormGroup {

          public constructor() {
            super({
                name: new AddReportFormControl("Report Name", "name", "",
                          Validators.required,
                          Validators.minLength(3),
                          Validators.maxLength(25)
                        ),

                priority: new AddReportFormControl( "Priority", "priority", "",
                          Validators.required)
            } )
          }


          public get formControls(): AddReportFormControl[] {
            return Object.keys(this.controls)
              .map(key => this.controls[key] as AddReportFormControl)
          }
        }

 3. Add a new method called getValidationMessages() to the AddReportFormControl
