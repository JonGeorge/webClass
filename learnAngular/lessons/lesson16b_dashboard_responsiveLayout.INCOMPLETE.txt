Lesson:  How to make the Dashboard Layout Responsive
----------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I have a dashboard that has 3 cards in the first row
          It looks fine on a wide screen
          -- I need it to show 2 cards on the first row for a smaller screen
          -- I need it to show 1 card on the first row for the smallest screen
          
Solution: Subscribe to the BreakpointObserver with the layout
          -- As the scren changes size, tell the HTML to increase/decrease the number of cards to display in the first row
