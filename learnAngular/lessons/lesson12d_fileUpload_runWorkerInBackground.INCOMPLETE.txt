Lesson:  File Upload is performed and run a java Callable worker (in the background)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  The user uploads a massive file and I need to show progress of processing
Solution: Submit a worker in the background and update a database record


Approach
 1) User uploads massive file
 2) REST call runs
    a) REST call creates a new JOBS database record (and gets a job id)
    b) REST call runs a worker in the background
    c) REST call returns the job id
 
 3) Front end starts polling every N seconds for updates on the record
    -- Need a REST endpoint that provides status information when passed-in a jobId
