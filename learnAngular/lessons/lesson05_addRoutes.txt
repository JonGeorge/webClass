Lesson:  Add Angular Routes
---------------------------



Procedure
---------
 1. Generate a not-found component
    NOTE:  This is the page to be displayed when a user browses to an invalid route

    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects/angularApp1
    unix> ng generate component notFound



 2. Add Routes
    a. Edit the app.module.ts

    b. Add this to the top of the file:

            const appRoutes: Routes = [
              { path: 'addReport', component: AddReportComponent},
              { path: '', redirectTo: '/', pathMatch: 'full'},
              { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent}
            ];


    c.  Add this to the imports: [ ] section
            RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)


 3. Try it out:
    a. Click on the "Add Report" button and you should see the "Add a Report" page
    b. Click on the "View Reports" button and you should see the "not-found works!" message as that component is not in the routes
