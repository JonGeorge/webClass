Add a Popup Angular Material Dialog to the Web App
--------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I want to popup a dialog to answer a few questions and then save the info


The one design question is which page will save the information?
  In Approach 1, the main page saves the information.  The dialog box simply returns info.
  In Approach 2, the dialog box saves the info.  The dialog box simply returns true/false flags.

**I prefer Approach 1**  (but either way works)



Approach 1:  The dialog box just returns data (it does not save any data)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Have your main page open the dialog box and wait for it to close.
     In the dialog box, the user can press "Cancel" or "Save"
	 If the user presses "Cancel", then no data is returned
	
  2. The user uses the dialog box and presses either "Cancel" or "save"
  
  3. The main listens for when the dialog box has closed
     Upon close, the main page checks for data returned
	 -- If no data is returned, then do nothing (as the user pressed "Cancel"
	 -- If data is returned then
	      a) invoke a 1st REST call to save the information 
	      b) invoke a 2nd REST call to reload the page (to display the info)


Approach 2:  The dialog box saves the data
------------------------------------------
  1. Have your main page open the dialog box and wait for it to close.
     In the dialog box, the user can press "Cancel" or "Save"
	 If the user presses "Cancel", then no data is returned
	
  2. The user uses the dialog box and presses either "Cancel" or "save"
     -- If the user presses "Save"
	      a) invoke a REST call to save the information
		  b) return "true" to the main page [so the main page knows to reload the page]
     -- If the user presses "Cancel",
	      a) Return false to the main page [so the main page knows to do nothing]
		  
  3. The main listens for when the dialog box has closed
     Upon close, the main page checks for data returned
	 -- If false is returned, then do nothing (as the user pressed "Cancel"
	 -- If true is returned then
	      a) invoke a 2nd REST call to reload the page (to display the info)


Procedure (using Approach 1)
----------------------------
 1. Create a main page that pulls a few detals from ES
 
 2. Create a popup (that returns data)
 
 3. Integrate main page and popup page
