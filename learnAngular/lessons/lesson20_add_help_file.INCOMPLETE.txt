Lesson:  Add Help File
----------------------
Web apps should have a help file (preferably a pdf that they can download).
+ Clients need to be able to say, "Yes, the webapp has help"  (so they can check off that box)
- But, most users will not read it.
+ Expert users will read it (looking for shutcuts and special tricks)
