Lesson 6: Add Spring Boot to the Structure
------------------------------------------

There are two approaches:
 1) Create one maven module that holds both the front-end and back-end
 2) Create two maven modules: One holds the front-end, another holds the back-end


Reasons to keep the webapp as one module
----------------------------------------
 + Simpler to debug:  Just kick off the webapp's main class and it's running
 ? Can you deub typescript this way?


Reasons to split the webapp into two modules
--------------------------------------------
 + Front-end people can still use "ng serve" for quick development
 + You can still run the entire webapp



The best approach should be the approach that lets you
 A) Debug the java code on the back-end
 B) Debug the typescript code on the front-end
 C) Let front-end developers use "ng serve"
