Lesson:  How to ensure that a bookmarked page opens the navbar with the correct navgroups opened/closed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  If a user opens a route from a bookmark, then the navgroups are not opened
            Going to http://localhost:4200/page/addReport 
	          -- should open the Reports navgroup 
	          -- should close the other navgroups
            -- should show the "Add Report" item as active
            
Approach:
 A) Add a method the NavbarService called routeChanged(newRoute)
 B) Update the NavbarComponent to listen for route changes 
    1. Inject the NavbarService into the NavbarComponent
    2. Have the NavbarComponent subscribe or listen for events
       If an event happens, then the Navbarcomponent updates the flags (to show the correct menubar)
