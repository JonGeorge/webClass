Lesson:  Improve the Angular lookup.service.ts Service by Making a REST Call
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  The add-report page needs to invoke a REST call to get the list of priorities
          This information is needed in the priorities dropdown
          This data is needed for the page to operate

 Approach 1: Use routes to make the lookup call **synchronous**
	- The REST call is synchronous
	- The entire page view *WAITS* for the REST call to resolve
	- No spinner
    NOTE:  This approach is considered poor practice
	

 Approach 2: Invoke REST call from ngOnInit()
    a. The add-report.component.ts has a public list of priorities
         public priorities: LookupDTO[];
    b. Inject the lookupService
	c. Have The add-report.component.ts ngOnInit() method will subscribe to the REST call
	    this.priorities = this.lookupService.getLookupWithType("priority");
	d. Add a flag indicating the REST call is running
	e. Clear the flag when the REST call finishes
	f. Add a method in ngOnDestroy() to cleanup
	- Complex to implement
	+ The REST call is asynchronous
    + We can show a spinner while the REST call is running 
	

 Approach 3: Use Async Pipe
    + The REST call is asynchronous
	+ Automatically cleans-up so that there are no memory leaks
	+ We can show a spinner
    + Async Pipe makes the rendering of data from observable and promise easier.
    + For promises, it automatically calls the then method.
    + For observables, it automatically calls subscribe and unsubscribe.
	+ Less complex than approach 2 because
