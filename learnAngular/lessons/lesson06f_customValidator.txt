Lesson:  Create a Custom Validator
----------------------------------
Sometimes, you need a custom validator -- not the usual is-required built-in validators

In our case, we want a custom validator that validates that this is true:
 The end_date is no more than 90 days greater than the start date
 
 If start_date==1/1/2020 and end_date==3/1/2020  --> That's good  (60 days between start and end date)
 If start_date==1/1/2020 and end_date==5/1/2020  --> That's bad  (150 days)
