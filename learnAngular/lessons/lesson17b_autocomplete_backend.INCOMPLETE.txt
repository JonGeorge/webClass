Lesson:  Add a backend mapping to ElasticSearch for autocomplete
----------------------------------------------------------------
There are several ways to do an auto-complete search with ElasticSearch

My favorite approach is to use ngrams of up to 15 characters
 1) Change the ES mapping to have an ngram of up to 15 characters
 2) Index the data with the ngram data
 3) Create a backend REST call that will search this ngram
 
 
Advantages/Disadvantages of ngrams
 + Matches any character (including spaces and special punctuation)
 - Makes the ES index consume more disk space
