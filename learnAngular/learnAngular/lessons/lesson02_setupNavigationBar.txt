    [if not see lesson01_setupAngular8App.txt]


Procedure
---------
 1. Open the angularApp1 project in Intellij

 2. Add bootstrap to the project
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects/angularApp1
    unix> npm install bootstrap
    -- You should see this dependency in your package.json file
         "bootstrap": "4.4.1"

 3. Create a component called app-navbar
    unix> ng generate component navbar
    -- You should see src/app/navbar/ with 4 files in it


 4. Replace the app.component.html so that it shows the newly created navbar component
       <h1>Angular App1</h1>
       <app-navbar></app-navbar>

 5. Verify that it works:
    a. Run the development server
       unix> ng serve
    b. Open a browser
    c. Connect to http://localhost:4200
       -- You should see this:
            Angular App1

            navbar works!

 6. Make the nav bar pretty
