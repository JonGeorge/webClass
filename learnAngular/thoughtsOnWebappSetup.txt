Thoughts on the frontend/backend split
--------------------------------------


Problem with backend being dependent upon frontend.jar
------------------------------------------------------
If you are changing the frontend, then you must recompile the frontend
 1. Run the backend in Intellij on localhost:8080
 2. Run the frontend from command-line on localhost:4200
 3. Connect to webpage at localhost:4200

This build structure works well for building for production
This build structure works poorly for local debugging
-- Need separate maven profiles for dev and prod




Approaches:
 1) in backend/pom.xml
      include frontend dependency with scope=runtime

    in frontend/pom.xml
        <build>
            <resources>
                <resource>
                    <directory>target/frontend</directory>
                    <targetPath>static</targetPath>
                </resource>
            </resources>
        </build>


 2. In backend/pom.xml
    a. include frontend dependency with scope=compile
    b. Modify springboot addResourceHandlers
       *or*
       In application.yaml
          spring.resources.static-locations=classpath:/custom/
