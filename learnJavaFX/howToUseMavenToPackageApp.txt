How to Use Maven to Package the JavaFX App (to Windows)
-------------------------------------------------------
Here is the situation:
 A) The development team is using Linux or Windows and all have Oracle Java JDK 1.8
 B) The production users run Windows and have an Oracle Java JRE 1.8
    -- I want my development team to use Maven to package up the app
    -- I do not want my production users to have to install anything


There are different ways to create these packages
 1) Use the javapackager tools that comes with your JDK (most basic tool)
 2) JavaFX Ant Tasks
 3) JavaFX Maven Plugin for a maven project


For building JavaFX apps with Maven:
 1) Use the com.zenjava maven JavaFX plugin with Java 8 and 9 AND/OR
 2) Use Java 8 or 9 and don't specify any kind of Maven dependency for JavaFX OR
 3) Use the org.openjfx maven JavaFX plugin with Java 11+.


Answer
------
If our production users are using Oracle Java JRE 8 and the developers are using Oracle Java JDK 1.8,
then everyone's java includes the JavaFX libraries
-- There are no special procedures
-- The Java 8 JRE and JDK already include all of the libraries
-- Use the *USUAL* procedures to build a Java UBER jar
