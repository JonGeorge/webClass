How to Use Maven to Package the JavaFX App (to Windows)
-------------------------------------------------------

Here is the setup
 A) The development team is using Linux or Windows and all have Oracle Java JDK 1.8
 B) The production users run Windows and have an Oracle Java JRE 1.8
    -- I want my development team to use Maven to package up the app
    -- I do not want my production users to have to install anything

There are different ways to create these packages
 1) Use the javapackager tools that comes with your JDK (most basic tool)
 2) JavaFX Ant Tasks
 3) JavaFX Maven Plugin for a maven project
