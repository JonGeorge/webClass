How to Delete a Kafka Topic (fully)
-----------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You have a $KAFKA_HOME variable set


Procedure
---------
 1. Create this bash script
    NOTE:  Make sure this script has no leading spaces
    unix> vi deleteTopic.sh

        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Enter name of topic to delete from zookeeper:"
        read topicName
        $KAFKA_HOME/bin/zookeeper-shell.sh localhost:2181 <<EOF
        rmr /brokers/topics/$topicName
        ls /brokers/topics
        quit
        EOF

 2. Make this script executable
    unix> chmod ugo+x deleteTopic.sh


 3. Create a sample topic called "stuff"
    unix> cd $KAFKA_HOME
    unix> bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic stuff


 4. List the topics
    unix> cd $KAFKA_HOME
    unix>  bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
    -- You should see the topic called "stuff"


 5. Delete your topic
    unix> ./deleteTopic.sh

    Enter name of topic to delete from zookeeper: stuff <enter>


 6. List the topics (you should see that "stuff" is not present)
     unix> cd $KAFKA_HOME
     unix>  bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
     -- You should see the topic called "stuff" is not present
