How to Create a Kafka Connector to ElasticSearch
------------------------------------------------

Problem:  You have a kafka queue that is receiving information (perhaps updates to keep a database in sync).
          You want to build a program that 
            (a) listens on a topic
            (b) writes data to ElasticSearch
