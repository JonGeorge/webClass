How to Solve the "Invalid Cursor Position" error
------------------------------------------------


I have some java code to loop through a query and put the results in a map
  String sql = "select id, name from table order by id";
  JdbcTemplate jt = new JdbcTemplate(this.dataSource);
  SqlRowSet rs = jt.queryForRowSet(sql);
  
  HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
  
  while (rs.next() ) {
    Integer id = rs.getInt("id");
    String value = rs.getString("value");
    
    map.put(id, value);
  }
  
  
 Symptoms
 --------
 While debugging the code, it would skip rows
 
 
 Solution
 --------
 Remove rs.next() from my Intellij watch points.
 -- I had rs.next() in the Intellij debugger watch points
 -- As a result, at every breakpoint, rs.next() was getting called
 

The code was fine.  My intellij debugger was causing the problem.
