How to Solve Apache Studio Connection Problem
---------------------------------------------

Problem:  Your Apache Studio keeps giving you SSL Handshake failure errors when attempting to connect to your SLAPD service (stand-alone LDAP daemon)
Why:      Apache Studio cannot handle the TLSCipherSuite encryption


Solution
--------  
 1) Edit the slapd.conf file
  
    # Comment out these two lines in your slapd.conf
    #TLSCipherSuite <%= tlsCipherSuite %>
    #security <%= security %>
 
 
 2) Restart your slapd service
    unix> service slapd stop
    unix> service slapd start
