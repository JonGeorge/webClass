The Surefire Plugin is used during the test phase of the build lifecycle.
It executes the unit tests of an application.

By default, the Surefire Plugin will automatically include all test classes with the following wildcard patterns:
    "**/Test*.java"       includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that start with "Test".
    "**/*Test.java"       includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "Test".
    "**/*TestCase.java"   includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "TestCase".



Procedures

Adjust your pom.xml by adding this plugin:

       <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
              <argLine>-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${basedir}/src/test/resources/myKeystore.jks
                       -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=secret
              </argLine>
