----------------------------------------------

Assumptions

 B) You have Eclipse installed
 C) Your Eclipse workspace is here:
      c:\tools\eclipse\workspace
 D) You want to clone an existing repository located here:

Procedures
----------
 1. Clone the project to your Eclipse workspace directory (using git on command-line)
    a. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><RUN>cmd
    
    b. In the DOS window, enter these commands:
       DOS> cd /d c:\tools\eclipse\workspace
       DOS> git clone https://github.com/traderres/webClass.git  webapps
       -- Now, the project is cloned to c:\tools\eclipse\workspace\webapps\

       WARNING:  If you try to clone the branch using this command:
                   git clone git@github.com:traderres/webapps.git webapps
                 Then, eclipse will have problems pushing changes up
                 
   

 2. Import the project into Eclipse 
    a. Startup Eclipse
    
    b. Pull File -> Import
    
    c. Select Git -> Projects from Git
       Press Next
    
    d. Select "Existing local repository"
       Press Next
       
    e. In the "Select a Git Repository"
       Press "Add..."
       Press "Browse..."
       -- Browse to your c:\tools\eclipse\workspace\webapps
       -- You should see c:\tools\eclipse\workspace\webapps\.git checked
       Press Finish
       Press Next
    
    f. In the "Select a wizard to use for importing projects"
       Check "Use the New Project Wizard"
       Press Finish

    g. In the "Project" page
       Project name:   webapps
       Location:       c:\tools\eclipse\workspace\webapps
       Press Finish


 3. Verify that git works by viewing the history
    Right-click on webapps -> Team -> Show in history
   
 
 WARNING:  
   1) Make sure you clone the project to a directory (in step 1) is to a directory within your eclipse workspace
   2) Make sure your project home directory (in step 2g) is the *same* directory
      In the above procedures, they are both c:\tools\eclipse\workspace\webapps
