How to Delete Multiple Branches
-------------------------------
Problem:  You have lots of branches you want to remove
Solution: Use xargs to delete many at once




Delete all branches that contain dc
-----------------------------------
unix> git branch | grep "dc" | xargs git branch -D



Delete all branches that start with dc
--------------------------------------
unix> git branch | sed  -e 's/ //g' | grep -E "^dc" | xargs git branch -D

      How it works:
        git branch       # Lists all branches with a few spaces in front of the branch name
        sed command      # Removes spaces
        grep command     # matches lines that start with dc
        xargs git branch # sends the output to the git branch -D command
