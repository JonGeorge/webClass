How to Create a Branch and Merge-in Changes
-------------------------------------------

Assumptions
 A) You have Git installed  [see howToInstallGitOnWindows.txt] 
 B) You have Git in your PATH
 C) You have an existing github repository located here:
       https://github.com/traderres/webapps.git
 D) You are authorized to commit changes to this repository
 
 

Procedure
---------
 1. Clone a repository
    DOS> cd /d c:\tools\intellij\workspace
    DOS> git clone https://github.com/traderres/webapps.git webapps
         -- Now, you should have this directory
            c:\tools\intellij\workspace\webapps
            
 2. Create a local branch
    DOS> cd /d c:\tools\intellij\workspace\webapps
    DOS> git branch testing
    
 3. Switch to the branch called "testing"
    DOS> git checkout testing
    
    NOTE:  You can create a branch and switch with one command:
           git checkout -b testing
    
 4. Switch to the branch called "master"
    DOS> git checkout master

 5. Switch to the branch called "testing"
    DOS> git checkout testing
    
 6. Make a change to your "testing" branch
    DOS> echo "Made a change" >> README.md
    DOS> git status
    
         On branch testing
         Changes not staged for commit:
            (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
            (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          
                  modified:   README.md
          
         no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
         
 7. Commit the change to your "testing" branch
    DOS>  git commit -a -m "made a change"
    DOS>  git log --oneline -s
    
 8. Merge the change 
    DOS> git checkout master
    DOS> git merge testing

         Fast-forward
           README.md | 1 +
           1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 
    DOS> git status
          Updating c432090..070a8ce
          Fast-forward
           README.md | 1 +
           1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
          
          c:\tools\intellij\workspace\webapps>git status
          On branch master
          Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
            (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
          
          nothing to commit, working directory clean

    DOS> git push
