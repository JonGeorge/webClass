How to Package up the Application
---------------------------------
When you're ready to release, you set the version to a number (without the -SNAPSHOT)

Procedure
---------
 1. Get the latest development branch
    unix> git checkout master
    unix> git branch -D development
    unix> git fetch -a
    unix> git checkout development

 2. Set the new release version number in the development branch  (no shapshot)
    unix>  mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.1.0  -DgenerateBackupPoms=false

 3. Commit and push the development (with the release version)

 4. Make a tag from development
    a. Connect to your Gitlab site
    b. Click on your project
    c. Click on tags
    d. Create a new tag (from development)

 5. Set the next snapshot version in the development branch 
    NOTE:  Increment from the last release and add the phrase -SNAPSHOT to it
    unix>  mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.0-SNAPSHOT  -DgenerateBackupPoms=false

 6. Commit and push the development (with the snapshot version)
    
 7. Inform the development team to get the latest development branch
