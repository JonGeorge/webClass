How to Rollback Branch to last Head
-----------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You have git installed
 
 
 Procedure
 ---------
  1. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
  2. Within the DOS window, type-in these commands:
     DOS> git add .
     DOS> git checkout master -f
 
     It will NOT create any commits as git revert does.
     It will NOT detach your HEAD like git checkout <commithashcode> does.
     It WILL override all your local changes and DELETE all added files since the last commit in the branch.
     It works only with branches names, so you can revert only to latest commit in the branch this way.
