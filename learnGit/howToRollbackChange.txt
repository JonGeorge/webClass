Procedure
---------
 1. Clone the webapps repository
    a. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
    b. In the DOS window, type-in these commands:
       DOS> cd /d c:\tools\intellij\workspace
       DOS> git clone https://github.com/traderres/webapps.git webapps
       
       Now, you should have this directory:
           c:\tools\intellij\workspace\webapps


 2. Edit the README.md file by adding a line to it
    DOS> cd /d c:\tools\intellij\workspace\webapps
    DOS> echo Here is my change that I want to rollback >> README.md
    
    DOS> git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    
        modified:   README.md
    
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


 3. Commit a change
    DOS> git commit -a -m "Making a change that I want to rollback"
    DOS> git status
    
    On branch master
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
      (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    nothing to commit, working directory clean


 4. Push the change to the repo
    DOS> git push
    Username for 'https://github.com':             <enter github username>
    Password for 'https://traderres@github.com':   <enter github password>
    github --credentials store: github: command not found

    To https://github.com/traderres/webapps.git
       f038a0f..cb0a0ab  master -> master

 5. Get the id using the git log
    DOS> git log --pretty=oneline
        
    cb0a0ab22358017905601af0472aefff0f34be09 Making a change that I want to rollback
    f038a0f281f37d1e6e549bc6bedf908d7cc1177f Made a 3rd change on 5/15

    070a8ce0b1c17fc44b44bf9954517517a483b323 made a change
    c4320904eb4f26742ff15dee547236dfe2a8ff27 hot fix change try #2
    4225b4aff25e4c01b87c838b038a19ac157d0fba made code change to UserInfo.java  
    
    
 4. Rollback the change
    a. Reset the index to the desired commit
       DOS> git reset --hard <commit>
 
    b. Move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
       DOS> git reset --soft HEAD@{1}

    c. Commit the changes
       DOS> git commit -m "Reverted code change"    
       DOS> git push -f

 
 
How to Rollback Branch to last Head
-----------------------------------
 DOS> git add .
 DOS> git checkout master -f
 
     It will NOT create any commits as git revert does.
     It will NOT detach your HEAD like git checkout <commithashcode> does.
     It WILL override all your local changes and DELETE all added files since the last commit in the branch.
     It works only with branches names, so you can revert only to latest commit in the branch this way.
