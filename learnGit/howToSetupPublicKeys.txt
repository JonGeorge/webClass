How to Setup Public Keys (to access your Github or Gitlab Repository)
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Procedure
---------
 1. Create your public key
    unix> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "myusername@yahoo.com"
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/adam/.ssh/id_ed25519):     <enter>
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):   <enter>
    Enter same passphrase again:                  <enter>
    
    -- Generates two files
        /home/adam/.ssh/id_ed25519
        /home/adam/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        
        
2. Provide the public file to your Github.com or GitLab
   a. Sigh-in to your github account
   b. Go to your profile
        https://github.com/settings/profile
      
   b. Go to SSH and GPG Keys
   c. Press "New SSH Key"
   d. In the screen
      Title:  Enter anything you want
      Key:    <Copy and paste the contents of your public file -- ends with .pub>
      Press "Add SSH Key"
  
  
3. Create a local config file that tells the SSH libraries to use your public key when talking to github
   NOTE:  This must be in your .ssh/ directory
   unix> vi ~/.ssh/config
  
    Host github.com
        User git
        HostName github.com
        PreferredAuthentications publickey
        IdentityFile /home/adam/.ssh/id_ed25519
 
   
   ## NOTE:  The config file references the private key (which does *NOT* end with .pub)
   

4. Make sure that that config file and private key (referenced in the config file) are only visible to you
   NOTE:  This is required in Unix
   unix> chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh/config
   unix> chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh/config/id_ed25519
   

6. Get the git@github.com url to clone your repository
   a. Login to your github account
   b. Go to your repository page
   c. Press "Code" -> Clone -> SSH
      -- You want to copy a url that looks like this:  git@github.com:traderres/webClass.git
      
      
7. Use the git@github.com url to clone your repository
   unix> cd /tmp
   unix> git clone git@github.com:traderres/webClass.git
   -- It should clone your repository
