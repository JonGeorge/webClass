How to Fix the Intellij Git Push Failure
----------------------------------------

Symptom:  You can commit Git changes to your local branch
          But, when you use Intellij to push to the Github repo, you get this error:
             Push failed
             fatal: Could not read from remote repository

Solution: Change your github ssh access to native


Procedure
---------
 1. Open your Intellij Project
 2. Pull File / Settings
 3. Browse to Verison Control -> Git
    SSH executable:  Native
    Press Apply
    Press OK
    
 4. Now, try to push your Git commit
    Pull VCS -> Git -> Push 
    Press the "Push" button
    -- It should work now
