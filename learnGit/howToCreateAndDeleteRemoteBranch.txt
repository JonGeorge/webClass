How to Create and Delete a Remote Branch
---------------------------------=------

Assumptions:
 A) You have git installed
 B) You have git in your PATH
 

Procedure
---------
 1. Clone a repository
    a. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
    b. Within the DOS window, type-in these commands:
       DOS> cd /d c:\tools\intellij\workspace
       DOS> git clone https://github.com/traderres/webapps.git webapps
       DOS> cd webapps
    
       
 
 2. View the current branches
    DOS> git branch
    * master
    
       
 
 3. Create a new branch called "hotfix"  [but do not switch over to it]
    DOS> git branch "hotfix"
   
    DOS> git branch
      hotfix
    * master    
    
       
 
 4. Switch-over to the branch called "hotfix"
    DOS> git checkout "hotfix"
    Switched to branch 'hotfix'
    
    DOS> git branch
    * hotfix
      master
    
       
 
 5. Make a change to the "hotfix" branch *AND* commit them
    DOS> echo "made a change to README.md in hotfix branch" >> README.md
    DOS> git commit -a -m "Updated readme.md as a change"
    DOS> git status
    On branch hotfix
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    
       
 
 6. Push the local branch to the repository
    DOS> git push -u origin hotfix

     * [new branch]      hotfix -> hotfix
    Branch hotfix set up to track remote branch hotfix from origin.
    
       
 
 7. Go to your Git site and verify that your branch exists
    If you are using Github and your username is traderres,
    then it would be here:
       https://github.com/traderres/webapps/branches
       -- And, you would see a branch called hotfix
    
       
 
 8. Switch-over to the branch called "master"
    DOS> git checkout "master"
    M       README.md
    Switched to branch 'master'
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.    
    
    
    DOS> git branch
      hotfix
    * master    
    
    
    DOS> type README.md
    -- You will see the changes are gone
    
       
 
 7. Switch-over to the branch called "hotfix"
    DOS> git checkout "hotfix"
    DOS> type README.md
    -- You will see the changes are there
     
       
 
 8. Switch-over to teh branch called "master"
    DOS> git checkout "master"   
     
       
 
 9. Delete the local branch called "hotfix"
    DOS> git branch -D "hotfix"
    
    DOS> git branch
    * master
     
       
 
10. Delete the remote branch called "hotfix"
    DOS> git push origin --delete "hotfix"
     
       
 
11. Go to your Git site and verify that your branch is not present
    If you are using Github and your username is traderres,
    then it would be here:
       https://github.com/traderres/webapps/branches
       -- And, you should see that the branch is gone
