How to Rename Local and Remote Branch
-------------------------------------
Solution:   Create a new local branch with the desired name, 
            push it to your remote, and then
            delete the old remote branch:

Assumptions:
 A) You have git installed
 B) You want to rename a local and remote branch to a new name
 

Procedure
---------
 1. Clone your repository
    DOS>
    
 2. Create a branch (with a bad name)
    DOS> git branch oldname
    DOS> git checkout oldname
    
 3. Commit a change locally
    DOS> echo This is a change >> README.md
    DOS> git commit -a -m "local change" 

 4. Push the branch to your remote repo
    DOS>  git push -u origin oldname
    
 5. Switchover to the master
    DOS> git checkout master
  
 6. View your branches
    DOS> git branch
      oldname
    * master  
    
 7. Rename the branch locally
    DOS> git branch -m oldname newname

    DOS> git branch
      newname
    * master


 8. Delete the remote branch   
    DOS> git push origin --delete oldname

 9. Push the new branch up to the repo
    DOS> git push -u --all                # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote
