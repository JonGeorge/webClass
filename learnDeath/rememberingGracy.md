On Fri 3/2/2018, Gracy passed away.

Tricia & I had a feeling that we were near the end, but we didn't want to admi it.  But, I want to remember Gracy for how she was:  warm, gentle, playful, and alive.

In the Summer of 2000, Tricia & I got her from the Howard County shelter.  I remember all of the little kitties.  And, Tricia was begging me, "Oh honey....Can we get three?"  In the end, we saw this one lethargic cat and went with her.  We had no idea if this cat would be nice or not.  All that we were sure of was the cat had surgery recently and was perhaps a year old.  And, we named her Gracy.  Although, I keep changing my mind of the spelling of her last name. 

We lived in an apartment and Gracy was marking her territory:  peeing on the bed and the carpet.  But, after awhile she got passed that.  She was our kitty.

In 2003, we purchased our house.  And, Tricia had to drive Gracy during the 20 minute car ride.  She was so miserable that she pissed on herself.  On our first day in our new house, I gave Gracy a bath in the kitchen sink.  After the bath, she was pretty freaked-out.  But, I remember thinking that in a few weeks she would be walking around like she owns the place.  Sure enough, after a few weeks, she was feeling pretty good in her new home.  Certainly, there was more room to explore.  But, she has always liked the house.

In 2005 (when Will was just a baby), I remember having Will on my lap on the week-end, napping away.  Gracy would climb onto the couch and sniff the boys. 

Over the years, the boys would learn to crawl (Gracy could stroll away), and then speed crawl (Gracy would run away).  But, I remember vividly one memory.  The boys had cornered Gracy and she could not get away.  The boys were trying to pet her but they were being too rough about it.  Gracy would not scratch back or hiss at them.  I rescued Gracy from that situation and got her away from the young boys.  But, the message was clear:  She would not scratch them.  And, she never did.

Sometime in 2017, Tricia noticed that Gracy was going deaf.  As someone who lost his hearing in the spring of 2013, I can definitely relate.  But, even though she was deaf, she would still pur and climb onto the kitchen chairs and "join" us for dinner.

Over the last few months, we noticed that Gracy has become a "lap kitty" -- i.e., a cat that would climb-up on the couch and sit on your lap.  This was out of character for her.  She never did that.  Tricia's theory is that she knew the end was near and wanted to be closer to us.  I agree completely.

On Thursday 3/1/2018, we noticed that Gracy was having problems moving.  She could barely walk.  She wasn't eating.  I feared the worst but never told Tricia.  On Friday morning 3/2/2018, my fears came true.  Tricia & I took Gracy to the local vet office.  And,
  they made it clear that she was dying.  Gracy has dufferent multiple strokes.  This probably explains
   why she could not walk on one leg the night before.  And, why she was hiding under the dining room
   table on Friday morning 3/2/2018.  She probably could not move.

The surgeon said that she could do all kinds of tests, but that the humane thing to do was to put her asleep.
  I drove back to the house to get the boys.  And, I had to tell the boys that they were going to say goodbye
  to Gracy. The boys & I were returned.  When we returned, we met-up with Tricia and Gracy.
  The doctor asked if we wanted to be around when they put her to sleep.  No one agreed to this.
  We drove home in a silent van to a silent house.  There are memories all over the house; they're everwhere.

But, on this incredilby sad day, I'm grateful for a few things:  (1) We all got a chance to say good bye, (2) we ended the suffering, and (3) how lucky we were to have 18 wonderful years with her.  

Goodbye, Gracy.  We will miss you.
