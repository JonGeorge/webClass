How to Grant your Unix Account with Admin right sto Cups in Centos 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  You want to administer printers 
          You open a browser
          http://localhost:631
          
          But, you get prompted for a username/password

Solution: Give your unix group admin access to cupts


Procedure
---------
 1. Edit the cups-files.conf
    unix>  sudo vi /etc/cups/cups-files.conf
    
    Change this section:
      # Administrator user group, used to match @SYSTEM in cupsd.conf policy rules...
      # This cannot contain the Group value for security reasons...
      SystemGroup sys root wheel
      
    To this:
      SystemGroup sys root wheel  <your unix group>
      

 2. Restart the cups service
    unix> systemctl restart cups
    
Now, you can modify your cups printers
