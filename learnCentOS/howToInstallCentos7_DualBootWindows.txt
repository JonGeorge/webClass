Procedure
---------
 1. Download the CentOS 7 Live CD (to try out on your computer without installing anything)
    (to verify that it works with your computer)
    a. Go to http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/
    b. Select a mirror
    c. Select CentOS-7-x86_64-LiveGNOME-1708.iso
       *OR*
       http://mirror.linuxfix.com/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-LiveGNOME-1708.iso
    
 2. Write the Centos ISO file to your flash USB Drive
    If you downloaded the Centos ISO using Windows, then use Rufus to write your ISO to your USB flash drive
         a. Connect your USB flash drive to your computer

         b. Download Rufus portable
            NOTE:  You do not need to install it
            1) Go to https://rufus.akeo.ie/
            2) Scroll down to downloads, click on a "portable" version
               *or*
                 Go to https://rufus.akeo.ie/downloads/rufus-2.12p.exe     [the portable version ends with p.exe]

            3) Save rufus-2.12p.exe to your c:\vault\

         c. Run rufus.exe (to write your ISO image to your USB drive)
            1) Run c:\vault\rufus-2.12p.exe
            2) It will prompt you to check for application updates
               Press No
            3) In the Rufus popup
               a) Set the Device:            (the drive letter of your USB drive)
               b) Set the Partition Scheme:  "MBR partition scheme for BIOS or UEFI"
               c) Check the checkbox "Create a bootable disk" using "ISO Image"
               d) Press the button next to "ISO Image"
                 -- Browse to where you saved CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso
               e) Press "Start"

            4) If you get an ISOHybrid image detected warning, then
                 Select "Write in ISO Image mode (Recommended)
                 press OK

            5) You will get a warning that all data will be destroyed.
               Press OK

           NOTE:  Leave the USB drive connected to your computer

     If you downloaded the Centos ISO using Linux, then use dd to write the ISO to your USB flash drive
         a. Connect your USB flash drive to your computer

         b. Run the fdisk -l command to find your flash drive
            In this case, mine is /dev/sdf
            unix> fdisk -l

             Disk /dev/sdf: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
             Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
             Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
             I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

         c. Setup your USB drive to have a FAT32 filesystem
            unix> sudo umount /dev/sdf
            unix> sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdf -I

         d. Write the Centos ISO to the USB Flash Drive *and* sync
            NOTES
            1) IMPORTANT:  Make sure the output device is the entire /dev/sdf  (not /dev/sdf1)
            2) The status=progress option tells dd to show progress info
            3) The bs=8MB          option tells dd to read and write 8 MB at a time
            4) The The sync command is important as sometimes dd returns before it is finished

            unix> cd ~/Downloads
            unix> sudo dd if=CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso of=/dev/sdf status=progress bs=8MB && sync

            W A I T     1 0     M I N U T E S


       Disconnect the USB Flash Drive (with the Centos distribution)

       Now, you should have a CentOS 7 bootable USB Flash Drive


 
 3. Boot your computer from the CD/DVD or flash drive
    Insert the CD/DVD or flash drive into your computer *and* restart your computer

    On Dell Laptops, you usually press F12 to see the boot manu

 1. Adjust the /etc/grub.conf 
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> vi /etc/grub.d/40_custom
  
    menuentry "Windows 7" {
     set root='(hd0,2)'
     chainloader +1
   } 
 
 
   # NOTE:
   #  In the 40_custom file, you might have to try a few different partitions to find Windows
   #   if you have Windows installed on the first partition of your first disk, you will use (hd0,1)
   #      set root='(hd0,1)'   # This entry has worked some times
   #      set root='(hd0,2)'   # This entry has worked other times
   
   
 2. Rebuild the grub boot loader
    a. Find your grub.cfg
       find / -type f -name "grub.cfg"

    b. Rebuild the grub boot loader
