How to Tell if an RPM is Installed
----------------------------------


Example:  Verify that httpd daemon is installed
-----------------------------------------------
unix> sudo yum list installed httpd
unix> echo $?   # Get the exit code
      0
      
      
An exit status of zero means this package is installed
An exit status of non-zero means this package is not installed
