Assumptions:
 A) You have a flash drive (for creating a Clonezilla Live distribution)
 B) You have a backup device  (that has more disk space than the partitions you want to backup)
 C) You want to backup your Centos Linux to the backup device


Procedure (to backup your hard drive to a backup device)
--------------------------------------------------------
 1. Download the Clonezilla USB Live ISO
    a. Go to http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable
       1) CPU architecture:  Select "amd64" (for Intel chips)
       b) File Type:         Select "iso"
       c) Repository:        Select "auto"

    b. Press "Download"
    c. Save clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso to your ~/Downloads directory

 2. Writ the Clonezilla USB Live ISO to your USB Flashdrive
    a. Connect your flashdrive to your computer

    b. Run fdisk to identify the device id
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> fdisk -l

       In my case, I see my 32 GB flash drive as /dev/sdg
            Disk /dev/sdg: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
            Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
            Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            Disk label type: dos
            Disk identifier: 0x31f1464f

    c. Setup the FAT32 filesystem on your USB flashdrive
       unix> umount /dev/sdg1 
             *or*
             umount /dev/sdg
       unix> mkfs.vfat /dev/sdg -I -v

    d. Use dd to write the clonezilla ISO file to your USB flashdrive device
       unix> cd ~/Downloads
       unix> dd if=clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso  of=/dev/sdg status=progress bs=8MB && sync

   
  3. Connect your backup hard-drive to your computer
     Connect your CloneZilla USB live Flashdrive
     Reboot

  4. Boot your computer from the CloneZilla USB live Flashdrive
     If using Dell, press F12 on startup and select USB drive


  5. You should see the Clonezilla Main Menu
     a. In the main clonzeZilla menu, select "Other modes of Clonezilla Live"
        Select "Clonezilla live (To RAM)"
     b. In the "Choose Language" screen, select English
     c. In the "Keyboard configuration" screen, select "Keep the default keyboard layout"
     d. In the "Start clonezilla" screen, select "Start Clonezilla"
     e. In the "Mode" screen, select "device-device" 
     f. In the "Mode" screen, select "Beginner"
     g. Select "disk_to_local_disk"
     h. In the "Choose local disk as source", select your **SOURCE** disk
     i. In the "Choose local disk as target", select your **TARGET* hard drive (backup hard drive)
     j. In the "Advanced Parameters", 
        If you don't know what you're doing, select "Skip checking/repairing source file system"
     k. In the "Action to perform when everything if finsihed", select "Choose reboot/shutdown"
     
     l. You will be prompted to run this command directory
        Press Enter to continue
        
     m. You will be prompted
        All of the data on the target disk will be DESTROYED
        Make sure that the destination disk is the correct
        Are you sure you want to continue?  Y
        
     n. You will be prompted again
        Are you sure you want to continue?  Y
       
     o. Do you want to clone the boot loader?
        Press Y
        
        -- You will see the status page    
     
      

How to Restore from a device
----------------------------
Easy, just connect your device to your computer and boot
 1. Connect your backup device to your computer
    If your backup device is a USB drive, then connect it up.
    If your backup device is a SATA hard drive, then insert it

 2. Boot-up your computer (using the backup device)
    You may have to press F12 or Escape on bootup
    In the boot menu, select your backup device
    -- You should see your computer
