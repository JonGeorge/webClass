How to Write an ISO to a USB Drive (using Centos 7)
---------------------------------------------------
Problem:  You downloaded an ISO and you want to write it to a USB drive


Solution #1:  Use dd
--------------------
 1. Insert your USB drive

 2. Run the mount command to find the device letter
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> mount
          -- I see that the device is /dev/sdf1

 3. Unmount the drive
    unix> umount /dev/sdf1

 4. Write your ISO to the device *and* sync
    NOTE:  status=progress  tells dd to show progress info
           bs=8MB           tells dd to read and write 8 MB at a time
           The sync command is important as sometimes dd returns before it is finished

    unix> dd if=CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso of=/dev/sdf1 status=progress bs=8MB && sync


Solution #2:  Use unetbootin

 1. Download unetbootin
    a. Go to http://unetbootin.github.io/linux_download.html
