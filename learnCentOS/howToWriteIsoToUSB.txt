How to Write an ISO to a USB Drive (using Centos 7)
---------------------------------------------------
Problem:  You downloaded an ISO and you want to write it to a USB drive

NOTE:  dd (on unix) and rufus.exe (on windows) are the most reliable ways



Solution #1:  Use dd
--------------------
 1. Insert your USB drive

 2. Run the mount command to find the device letter
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> mount
          -- I see that the device is /dev/sdf1

 3. Unmount & Format your USB drive to FAT32
    unix> umount /dev/sdf1
    unix> sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdf1

 4. Write your ISO to the device *and* sync
    NOTES
      1) IMPORTANT:  Make sure the output device is the entire /dev/sdf  (not /dev/sdf1)
      2) The status=progress option tells dd to show progress info
      3) The bs=8MB          option tells dd to read and write 8 MB at a time
      4) The The sync command is important as sometimes dd returns before it is finished

    unix> dd if=CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso of=/dev/sdf status=progress bs=8MB && sync
