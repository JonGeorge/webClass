How to Configure Brightness on Login in Centos 7
------------------------------------------------
Problem:  Your laptop screen or keyboard backlit come-up some default color and you want to change it

 -- The keyboard backlit is set in the /sys directory
 -- The /sys directory gets restored after every reboot  (it's a fake filesystem)
 -- We need to create a unix script (called configure-brightness) that will set the brightness to zero
 -- We need to give our user the ability to run this script without a password

etely


Approach
 1) Determine which file (under /sys/class/leds sets the brightness
 2) Create a configure-brightness script (that will set the brightness on login)
 3) Adjust visudo so that you can run configure-brightness as root [without prompting for a password]
 4) Run configure-brightness when you open a shell


Procedure
---------
My Dell Latitude keyboard has a backlit that goes dark and lights-up when I start typing
Here are the steps to disable the keyboard backlit compl

 1. Look for the brightness file for your backlist
    NOTE:  It is probably under /sys/class/leds/
    unix> sudo -s

    # On my Dell Latitude E6540, the file is located here
    unix> cat /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness
    4

    So, on my dell Latitude E6540, the default keyboard backlit is 4


    # Attempt to run a command that turns the keyboard brightness off
    unix> echo 0 | tee /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness
          -- If the keyboard backlit turns off,
             then we have the right command to put into our configure-brightness script

         Setting the number in this file to zero --> No backlit
         Setting the number in this file to 4    --> bright keyboard backlit


 2. Create this file:  /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness
    a. Create the script
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> vi /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness

         # Disable the keyboard brightness
         echo 0 | tee /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

    b. Set the permissions on the script so others can run it
       unix> chmod ugo+rx /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


 3. Allow your unix account to run this script as root (without prompting for the password)
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> visudo

        # Remove this line
        <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL

        # Add these lines
        <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL
        <your unix username> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


 4. Verify that you can run this command without prompting for a password
    a. Open a new terminal
       unix> sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness
          -- You should *NOT* be prompted for a password
          -- The keyboard backlit should be adjusted


 5. If you are running the MATE Window Manager
    Then, you can set it up to startup for you
    a. Create a wrapper script
       unix> mkdir -p ~/scripts
       unix> vi ~/scripts/brightness-wrapper.sh

          # Run the command to disable the keyboard backlit
          sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness

    b. Tell MATE to run the brightness-wrapper.sh script on startup
       1) Pull System -> Preferences -> Personal -> Startup Applications
       2) Press "Add"
       3) In the "Add Startup Program" popup
          name:     Configure Brightness
          command: /home/<your username>/scripts/brightness-wrapper.sh
       4) Press "Add"

    NOTE:  Under the hood, you are creating this file:
           unix> cat ~/.config/autostart/brightness-wrapper.sh.desktop




 5b.**ALTERNATIVE**
     If you are not running the MATE Window Manager.
     Setup your .bashrc so that this command is run every time you open a terminal
     unix> vi ~/.bashrc

          # Add this to the end

          # Set the brightness
          sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


 6. Verify it works
    a. Reboot and see if it works
       unix> sudo reboot
