How to Disable the Keyboard Backlit on Login
--------------------------------------------
Problem: I want to disable the keyboard backlit on my laptop
      -- The keyboard backlit is set in the /sys directory
      -- The /sys directory gets restored after every reboot  (it's a fake filesystem)
      -- We need to create a unix script (called configure-brightness) that will set the brightness to zero
      -- We need to give our user the ability to run this script without a password


My Dell Latitude keyboard has a backlit that goes dark and lights-up when I start typing
Here are the steps to disable the keyboard backlit completely


Procedure
---------
 1. Look for the brightness file for your backlist
    NOTE:  It is probably under /sys/class/leds/
    unix> sudo -s

    # On my Dell Latitude E6540, the file is located here
    unix> cat /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

    # Attempt to run a command that turns the keyboard brightness off
    unix> echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness
    -- If the keyboard backlit turns off,
        then we have the right command to put into our configure-brightness script

    Setting the number in this file to zero --> No backlit
    Setting the number in this file to 4    --> bright keyboard backlit


 2. Create this file:  /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness
    a. Create the script
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> vi /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness

      # Disable the keyboard brightness
      echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

    b. Set the permissions on the script so others can run it
       unix> chmod ugo+rx /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


 3. Allow your unix account to run this script as root (without prompting for the password)
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> visudo

     # Change the last few lines from this:
     <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL

     # Let this unix account run a script without prompting for a password
     <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL
     <your unix username> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


 4. Verify that you can run this command without prompting for a password
    a. Open a new terminal
    b. Run this command
       unix> sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness
       -- You should *NOT* be prompted for a password
       -- The keyboard backlit should be adjusted


 5. Setup your environment, so that every time you open a bash shell
    You call the configure-brightness command
    unix> vi ~/.bashrc

     # Set the brightness
     sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


 6. Verify it works
    a. Reboot and see if it works
       unix> sudo reboot

    b. Upon login, open a shell
      -- The keyboard backlit should be set to what you want
