How to Tell the Cups Daemon to NOT keep Job History
---------------------------------------------------
Problem:  By default CUPS will keep old job files and job history
          -- The cups website at http://localhost:631/ lets you re-print jobs
          -- I don't want old print jobs left around
          -- Files accumulate in /var/spool/cups
