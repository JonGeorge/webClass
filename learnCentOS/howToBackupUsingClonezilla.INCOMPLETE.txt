Assumptions:
 A) You have a flash drive (for creating a Clonezilla Live distribution)
 B) You have a backup device  (that has more disk space than the partitions you want to backup)
 C) You want to backup your Centos Linux to the backup device

Procedure
---------
 1. Convert your flashdrive into a Clonezilla USB Live flashdrive
    a. Go to http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable
       1) CPU architecture:  Select "amd64" (for Intel chips)
       b) File Type:         Select "zip"   (for USB flash drive)
       c) Repository:        Select "audo"

    b. Press "Download"
    c. Save clonezilla-live-2.5.2-31-amd64.zip to your ~/Downloads directory

 2. Format your flash drive to use FAT32 filesystem
    a. Connect your flashdrive to your computer

    b. Run fdisk to identify the device id
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> fdisk -l

       In my case, I see my 32 GB flash drive as /dev/sdg
            Disk /dev/sdg: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
            Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
            Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            Disk label type: dos
            Disk identifier: 0x31f1464f

    c. Setup the FAT32 filesystem on your USB flashdrive
       unix> umount /dev/sdg
       unix> mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdg -I -v

    d. Disconnect your USB flashdriveand then re-connect it

    e. Find the device letter for you USB flashdrive
       unix> df -h

       I see my flash drive with this line
       /dev/sdg         30G   16K   30G   1% /run/media/adam/26F8-0AEE

    f. Write the clonezilla data files to your USB flashdrive device letter
       NOTE:  we use /dev/sdg1 as the device
       unix> cd ~/Downloads
       unix> unzip clonezilla-live-2.5.2-31-amd64.zip -d  /dev/sdg1

       -- Now, you have a CloneZilla USB live Flashdrive


  3. Connect your backup hard-drive to your computer
     Connect your CloneZilla USB live Flashdrive
     Reboot

  4. Boot your computer from the CloneZilla USB live Flashdrive
     If using Dell, press F12 on startup and select USB drive
