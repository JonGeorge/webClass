Procedure
---------
 1. Install esc (Enterprise Security Client Smart Card Client) which will cause the ccid, coolkey, pcsc-lite, and pcsc-lite-libs dependancies to be installed.
    unix> sudo yum install esc
 
 2. Reboot
 
 3. Verify that it found it
    unix> dmesg | grep -i reader

    You should see this:
        usb 3-3: Product: SCR3500 A Contact Reader

 4. Configure the "CAC Reader" Security Device in the x86_64 version of Firefox: 
    a. Startup Firefox
    b. Pull Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Certificates
    c. Press "Security Devices"
    d. Press Load
       Module Name:      MyCardReader
       Module filename:  /usr/lib64/pkcs11/libcoolkeypk11.so
       
      The "CAC Reader" module will now appear in the previous window, and, if you have a CAC Reader plugged into the computer with a CAC inserted, your personal information will appear as well.
