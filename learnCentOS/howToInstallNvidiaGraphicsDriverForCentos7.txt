How to get graphics card info
-----------------------------
unix> /sbin/lspci | grep -i VGA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK208 [GeForce GT 720] (rev a1)



Procedure
----------
 1. First update your system. We do not wand to build NVidia modules on based on outdated Linux kernel. 
    Do a full updated and reboot your system:
    unix> sudo yum update
    unix> sudo reboot

 2. After a restart we make sure that we have kernel devel package installed matching our currently running kernel 
    and that compiler is installed:
    unix> sudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) gcc
 
 3. Go to nvidia.com and download the current nvidia driver -- e.g., NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.30.run
    a. Go to http://www.nvidia.com
    b. Click on Drivers -> GEForce Drivers  
    c. Under Manual Driver Search, press Start Search
       Top Menu:  Choose GeForce
       2nd Manu:  Choose GeForce 700 Series
       3rd Menu:  Choose GeForce GT 720
       4th menu:  Choose Linux 64-bit
       5th Menu:  English (US)
       6th menu:  Recommended/Certified
       Press "Start Search"
       -- Click to download the latest driver
       -- Save the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-384.90.run

 4. Blocklist the nouveau driver 
    At this stage we need to ensure that a new propriatery NVidia driver does not get into a conflict with currently installed  Nouveau driver thus we blacklist it: 
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> echo 'blacklist nouveau' >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
    unix> dracut /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r) --force

 5. Temporarily disable desktop manager ( if you ar running kdm that updated the below command with kdm ):
    unix> systemctl disable gdm

 6. Reboot your system without a desktop window manager
    Next time your system boots it will boot to terminal only with no GUI. 
    unix> sudo reboot
  
 7. Install the NVIDIA GeForce Driver
    unix> cd ~/Downloads
    unix> sudo bash ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.30.run
   
    a. You will be prompted to Accept the license Agreement
       Press "Accept"
       
    b. You will be prompted to install 32-bit compatible libraries
       Press "Yes"
       
    c. Would you like to run the nvidia-xconfig utility?
       Press "Yes"
    
    d. Installation is now complete
       Press "Ok"


 8. Enable again your desktop manager and reboot to GUI with new NVidia driver: 
    unix> sudo systemctl enable gdm
    unix> sudo ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/gdm.service' '/etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service'
    unix> sudo reboot

 9. Verify that you have installed the driver successfully
    unix> Pull System -> Preferences -> Other -> NVIDIA X Server Settings
          *OR*
    unix> /usr/bin/nvidia-settings
    You should see "NVIDIA X Server Settings"
    

How to revert the change
------------------------
You  should be able to revert by removing line 'blacklist nouveau' from /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and re-run the dracut command.
  unix> sudo -s
  unix> vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
         
        # Remove the blacklist noveau 

  unix> dracut /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r) --force
  unix> reboot
