    [see learnCentos / howToInstallCentos7_ToPortableHardDrive.txt]
    a. Download CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso
    b. Burn to a flash drive
    c. Connect the flash drive to your computer
    d. Boot from your flash drive

 2. In the "Centos 7" menu, select "Troubleshooting"

 3. In the "Troubleshooting" menu, select "Rescue a CentOS system"

 4. At the rescue prompt, select "1" to Continue

 5. Press Enter to get a shell

 6. Setup your root environment
    unix> chroot /mnt/sysimage

 7. Identify your hard-drive
    unix> ls /dev/sd*
    -- You should see /dev/sda /dev/sda1, ....

 8. List the grub2 commands you can use
    unix> ls /sbin | grep grub2
