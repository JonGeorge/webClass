       Create the following 3 mount points
          /boot       1 GIB   # Holds the grub boot loader
          swap       12 GiB   # Holds your swap file.    If 6 GB of RAM, set for somewhere between 6 and 12 GIB
          /         137 GiB   # Remaining space on your centos operating system


       1) Press the "+" to create a mount point
             Mount Point:  /boot
             Capacity:     1 GiB         # NOTE:  1 GB=1000 MB  and  1 GIB=1024 MB

    NOTES:
      -- The keyboard backlit is set in the /sys directory
      -- The /sys directory gets restored after every reboot  (it's a fake filesystem)
      -- We need to create a unix script (called configure-brightness) that will set the brightness to zero
      -- We need to give our user the ability to run this script without a password


    My Dell Latitude keyboard has a backlit that goes dark and lights-up when I start typing
    Here are the steps to disable the keyboard backlit completely

    a. Look for the brightness file for your backlist
       NOTE:  It is probably under /sys/class/leds/
       unix> sudo -s

       # On my Dell Latitude E6540, the file is located here
       unix> cat /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

       # Attempt to run a command that turns the keyboard brightness off
       unix> echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness
       -- If the keyboard backlit turns off,
            then we have the right command to put into our configure-brightness script

       Setting the number in this file to zero --> No backlit
       Setting the number in this file to 4    --> bright keyboard backlit


    b. Create this file:  /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness
       1) Create the script
          unix> sudo -s
          unix> vi /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness

         # Disable the keyboard brightness
         echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

       2) Set the permissions on the script so others can run it
          unix> chmod ugo+rx /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


    c. Allow your unix account to run this script as root (without prompting for the password)
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> visudo

        # Change the last few lines from this:
        <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL

        # Let this unix account run a script without prompting for a password
        <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL
        <your unix username> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


    d. Verify that you can run this command without prompting for a password
       1) Open a new terminal
       2) sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness
          -- You should *NOT* be prompted for a password
          -- The keyboard backlit should be adjusted


    e. Setup your environment, so that every time you open a bash shell
       You call the configure-brightness command
       unix> vi ~/.bashrc

         # Set the brightness
         sudo /usr/local/bin/configure-brightness


    f. Verify it works
       1) Reboot and see if it works
          unix> sudo reboot

       2) Upon login, open a shell
          -- The keyboard backlit should be set to what you want
