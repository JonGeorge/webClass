How to Install Centos 7 to a Portable USB Drive
-----------------------------------------------
Problem:  You want to run Centos 7 natively (not through VirtualBox)
          Your laptop/desktop is running Windows
          You are not authorized to dual boot

Approach:
 1) Buy a portable USB 250 GB hard drive -- e.g., Western Digital Nano 250 GB drive
 2) Buy a small USB flash drive (16 GB or more)
 3) Burn Centos 7 ISO to your USB flash drive
 4) Install Centos 7 by connecting the Flash Drive and portable drive to your computer


Procedure
---------
 1. Purchase a fast portable drive -- e.g., Western Digital Nano 250 GB drive

 2. Download the CentOS 7 ISO file
    a. Go to http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/
    b. Click on a mirror
    c. Click on CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso
       *OR*
    b. Go to http://mirrors.maine.edu/CentOS/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso

 3. Write the Centos ISO file to your flash USB Drive
    If you downloaded the Centos ISO using Windows, then use Rufus to write your ISO to your USB flash drive
        a. Connect your USB flash drive to your computer

        b. Download Rufus portable
           NOTE:  You do not need to install it
           1) Go to https://rufus.akeo.ie/
           2) Scroll down to downloads, click on a "portable" version
              *or*
                Go to https://rufus.akeo.ie/downloads/rufus-2.12p.exe     [the portable version ends with p.exe]

           3) Save rufus-2.12p.exe to your c:\vault\

        c. Run rufus.exe (to write your ISO image to your USB drive)
           1) Run c:\vault\rufus-2.12p.exe
           2) It will prompt you to check for application updates
              Press No
           3) In the Rufus popup
              a) Set the Device:            (the drive letter of your USB drive)
              b) Set the Partition Scheme:  "MBR partition scheme for BIOS or UEFI"
              c) Check the checkbox "Create a bootable disk" using "ISO Image"
              d) Press the button next to "ISO Image"
                -- Browse to where you saved CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso
              e) Press "Start"

           4) If you get an ISOHybrid image detected warning, then
                Select "Write in ISO Image mode (Recommended)
                press OK

           5) You will get a warning that all data will be destroyed.
              Press OK

          NOTE:  Leave the USB drive connected to your computer

    If you downloaded the Centos ISO using Linux, then use dd to write the ISO to your USB flash drive
        a. Connect your USB flash drive to your computer

        b. Run the fdisk -l command to find your flash drive
           In this case, mine is /dev/sdf
           unix> fdisk -l

            Disk /dev/sdf: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
            Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
            Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

        c. Unmount & Format your USB drive to FAT32
           unix> sudo umount /dev/sdf
           unix> sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdf -I
           unix> dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdf status=progress    # Optional step
           
        d. Write the Centos ISO to the USB Flash Drive *and* sync
           NOTES
           1) IMPORTANT:  Make sure the output device is the entire /dev/sdf  (not /dev/sdf1)
           2) The status=progress option tells dd to show progress info
           3) The bs=8MB          option tells dd to read and write 8 MB at a time
           4) The The sync command is important as sometimes dd returns before it is finished

           unix> cd ~/Downloads
           unix> sudo dd if=CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso of=/dev/sdf status=progress bs=8MB && sync

           W A I T     1 0     M I N U T E S


      Disconnect the USB Flash Drive (with the Centos distribution)

      Now, you should have a CentOS 7 bootable USB Flash Drive

 6. Remove all partitions from your portable USB hard drive
    NOTE:  This is not the same as formatting one partition
    If you have a linux computer, follow these steps
        a. Connect your usb drive to your linux environment
        b. List your devices
           unix> sudo -s
           unix> fdisk -l

        c. Find the device that is your portable hard-drive -- e.g., /dev/sdf
           -- It should have a size close to your USB derive
           -- In my case, my USB hard-drive has a size of 250 GB so I see this

               Disk /dev/sdf: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes, 488397168 sectors
               Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
               Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
               I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 33553920 bytes
               Disk label type: dos

        d. Delete the partitions under /dev/sdf
           unix> fdisk /dev/sdf

           Command (m for help):  p   <enter>       # this will print the partitions on this device
           Command (m for help):  d   <enter>       # keep running this command until all partitions are deleted
           Command (m for help):  d   <enter>       # keep running this command until all partitions are deleted
           Command (m for help):  w   <enter>       # this is a write and exit

    If you are running Windows 10, then
        a. Connect your usb drive to your linux environment
        b. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
        c. In the DOS window, type-in
           diskpart
