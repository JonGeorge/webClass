Procedure
---------
 1. Make sure my local account can ssh to localhost [without prompting for password]
    unix> cd ~
    unix> ssh-keygen -t rsa
          Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hadoop/.ssh/id_rsa):   <press enter>
            
          Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):    <press enter>
          Enter same passphrase again:                   <press enter>

    unix> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    unix> chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


 2. Verify that your account can ssh to localhost without prompting for a password
    NOTE:  This ssh command should *not*  ask for password but first time it will prompt for adding RSA to the list of known hosts.
    unix> ssh localhost
       
    The authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 9b:35:ab:51:bc:6e:92:ff:a5:4f:2d:a9:11:d5:36:ae.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?                    yes
    
 3. Build the quickinstall
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects
    unix> git clone https://github.com/accumulobook/quickinstall accQuickInstall
    unix> cd accQuickInstall
    unix> mvn clean package
          -- Now, I have ~/intellijProjects/accQuickInstall/target/accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz

4. Setup the quickinstall package
   unix> cd ~
   unix> cp ~/intellijProjects/accQuickInstall/target/accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz
   unix> tar zxvf accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz
   unix> rm accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz
         -- Now, I have ~/quickinstall-home
         

5. Install the package
   unix> cd ~/quickinstall-home
   unix> ./bin/install
   
RSA key fingerprint is db:94:41:dd:d9:03:c5:67:38:04:87:2c:25:75:53:d6.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  Yes
