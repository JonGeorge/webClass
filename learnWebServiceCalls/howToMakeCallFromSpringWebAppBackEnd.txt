-----------------------------------------------------------------

INCOMPLETE


 
Procedure
---------
 1. Create an HttpUtils class that has methods needs to run web service calls
 
 
 
 2. Add a back-end method that calls a web service call and *waits* for a response
    -- So, the user runs a search
    -- The search back-end method does the following:
         a) The search back-end makes a call to solr and *waits* for a response
         b) The search back-end returns the result to the front-end
    
    
 
 3. Add a back-end method that calls a web service does *not* wait for a response
    Why?  Suppose you have some auditing method that you need to do on a search
          -- So, the user runs a search
          -- The search back-end method does the following:
               a) The back-end makes a web service call to audit the search
                  NOTE:  This web service call does not wait for a response
               b) The back-end makes a call to solr and waits for a response
               c) The back-end returns the result to the front-end
