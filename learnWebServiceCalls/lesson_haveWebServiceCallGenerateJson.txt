Lesson:  When consuming a web service call and you want JSON, have the web service generate the JSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Assumption:
 A) You are making a web service call
 B) You want to get JSON back


Procedure
---------
 1. Pass-in the Accept:application/json header to your web service call when consuming rest services
    
    Why?  So, that *YOU* do not have to convert the XML to JSON
    
    Especially in Grails webapps:  The Grails webapp class-loader does funny things.  You might get JSON back, you might not.
    
    SOLUTION:  Pass-in the Accept:application/json header so that you do not need to parse the XML in the first place
