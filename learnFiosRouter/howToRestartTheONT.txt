How to Restart Your Optical Network Terminal (ONT)
--------------------------------------------------

Approach 1:
 1) Go to the basement (where the battery backup used to be)
 2) Verify the light is on   (if the light is on, then the ONT is getting power)
 3) Pull the power, wait 30 seconds, insert the power
    -- After 10 minutes should be up


Approach 2:
 1) Press-and-hold a switch on the left side of the box for 15 seconds  
    -- This should cause the ONT to restart
