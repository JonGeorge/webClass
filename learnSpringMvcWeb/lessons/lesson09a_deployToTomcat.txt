How to Deploy your Web App to Tomcat
------------------------------------


Procedure
---------
 1. Build your war file
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects/webapp1
    unix> mvn clean package
         
          -- This creates a ./target/webapp1.war
          
 2. Get the property file that corresponds to this environment
 
 3. Upload your property file and webapp1.war file to your Tomcat Server
 
 4. Copy the property file to <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib      
 
 5. Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat
    
    Approach #1:  Copy the webapp1.war file to <TOCMAT-HOME>/webapps
      -- By default, Tomcat watches this directory for new .war files
      -- Tomcat will unzip the WAR file
      -- Tomcat will attempt to deploy the WAR file
         NOTE:  This assumes that the system admin has not turned-off this feature
         
    Approach #2:  Use the Tomcat manager web app
      -- Open a browser
      -- Go to http://www.TomcatServer.com/manager
      -- Enter the Tomcat manager-gui username/password
         NOTE:  This is stored in the <TOMCAT-HOME>/conf/tomcat-users.xml
            
    
    Approach #3:  Use a Maven plugin to upload your WAR file to Tomcat
  
  
    Approach #4:  Create a Jenkins job that will upload the WAR file to <TOMCAT-HOME>/webapps

 6. Verify that the web app actually started
    -- Check the log files
