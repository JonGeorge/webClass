How to Deploy your Web App to Tomcat
------------------------------------


Procedure
---------
 1. Build your war file
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects/webapp1
    unix> mvn clean package
         
          -- This creates a ./target/webapp1.war
          
 2. Upload your property file and webapp1.war file to your Tomcat Server
    -- Upload to your <TOMCAT-HOME>/lib/
    
       
 3. Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat 
    There are 2 approaches
    
    Approach #1:  Manually Copy the webapp1.war file to <TOCMAT-HOME>/webapps
	    a. Upload your WAR file to the server
	    b. Copy the property file to <TOMCAT-HOME>/webapps/
	       -- By default, Tomcat watches <TOMCAT-HOME>/webapps/ for new .war files
	       -- Tomcat will unzip the WAR file
	       -- Tomcat will attempt to deploy the WAR file
 
         
    Approach #2:  Use the Tomcat Manager to deploy your web app
	    a. Open a browser
	    b. Go to http://www.TomcatServer.com/manager
	    c. Enter the Tomcat manager-gui username/password
	       NOTE:  This is stored in the <TOMCAT-HOME>/conf/tomcat-users.xml
	            
	    d. Click on the "Manager App" button
	    e. Scroll down to the "WAR file to deploy" section
	       1) Press "Browse..."
	       2) Browse to where your .WAR file is located
	       3) Press "Deploy
	       -- Your web app will be uploaded to Tomcat
	       -- Tomcat will unzip the WAR file
	       -- Tomcat will attempt to deploy the WAR file

    
 4. Verify that the web app actually started
    -- If you are using the Tomcat Manager, you will see a column called "Running"
       Verify that "Running" says true
    -- Check the log files
   	-- Connect to your web app
