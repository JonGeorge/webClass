Part 1:  HTML Page Structure
----------------------------
The basic structure of any web page is as follows:
   
Exercise 1:  Create a basic page called form1.html
   a) Startup Notepad++ 
   b) Copy the html below into Notepad++
   c) Pull File / Save and save the file as webpage1.html (on your desktop)
   d) Open your page in a web browser:  Double-click on webpage1.html
     

 <html>
     <head>
        <!-- You should see "Web Page 1" in the browser title or browser tab -->
        <title>Web Page 1</title>
     </head>
     
     <body>
        <!-- HTML Comments are not shown directly to the user -->
        <h2>Hello There</h2>
        
        This is the main page.
        
        <!-- This br tag acts as a manually carriage return -->
        <br/>
        
        As you can see, carriage returns are removed.
        
        And,   tabs   and   extra          spaces    are  removed.
        
     </body>
 </html>
 
 
 
What do you notice?
-------------------
   1) Carriage returns are ignored (so are tabs and extra spaces
   2) The <head><title>...</title></head> tag is special -- visible in the browser title
   3) Comments are ignored (but visible in view page source)
   4) Your browser (firefox or Internet Explorer) converts the HTML into a web page (all web browsers do this)
  
  
  
  
Exercise:
---------
 1) Create a new web page and put your name in it
 2) Open the web page with Firefox and Internet Explorer
