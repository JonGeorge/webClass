How to Setup a JDBC Connection Pool using C3P0
----------------------------------------------



Setting-up a connection pool has the following elements:
 1) web.xml 
    -- Tells the app server to look at the ApplicationWatcherForC3P0 class upon web context startup and shutdown
    
 2) Conect.xml  
    -- Holds the plain-text database username & password
    -- Holds the encoded    database username & password
   
 3) ApplicationWatcherForC3P0 class
    -- Starts the connection pool upon web app startup 
    -- Stops the connection pool upon web app shutdown
    
 4) DaoUtils
    -- Java singleton that is used to get a datasource
    
 5) EncryptedDataSourceFactoryForC3P0
    -- Java class that extends the data source factory used by C3P0
    -- This class decodes the username & password
