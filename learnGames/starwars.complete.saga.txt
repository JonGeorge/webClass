1. INTRODUCTION
******************************************************************************

Welcome, readers, to my FAQ/Walkthrough for LEGO Star Wars: The Complete 
Saga, for the Nintendo Wii!  A compilation of the two LEGO Star Wars games, 
updated for the newest generation of consoles, you can now have the entire 
LEGO Star Wars experience in one game.  In this guide, you'll find 
walkthroughs for each mission in the Story, quick runthroughs of each 
mission on Free Play, including how to find all the Minikits and Power Bricks, 
as well as the means to unlock and pass the myriad bonus missions in the 
game.

******************************************************************************
2. FAQ
******************************************************************************

Q: What is LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga?

A: This is a full compilation of both recently released LEGO Star Wars games, 
 on the current generation of consoles.

Q: What is the ESRB rating of this game?

A: This game is rated E10+, with the added descriptor of Cartoon Violence.

Q: Would this game be good for my kids?

A: Absolutely so.  There's almost no objectionable material during gameplay.  
 All violence is done to LEGO bricks, not real people.  The game is very 
 forgiving in the sense of difficulty, encourages exploration and critical 
 thinking, as well as working together with a friend.  However, there are 
 certain situations that mirror the movies, such as the LEGO characters 
 dying or being dismembered (ie. Qui-Gon's death or Luke losing his hand) 
 which are kinda played down given the goofy nature of the LEGOs.

Q: How many people can play?  Does this game require a Nunchuk?

A: Two, and yes.

Q: So, what's changed from the individual games?  Has a lot of new stuff been 
 added?

A: This game is more than just a "mash-up" of the two individual games.  
 Steps have been taken to make all six episodes one cohesive experience.  The 
 Original Trilogy has had the fewest modifications, as the game was just about 
 perfect as it was.  The Prequel Trilogy has had updates to bring it up to 
 speed with LSW2's gameplay-style.  Here are all the changes as a list:

 - The Mos Eisley Cantina is now the hub for the entire game, and has been 
  significantly redesigned to reflect this.
 - A new mission has been added to the beginning of Episode II: Bounty Hunter 
  Pursuit (which was cut from the original LSW).
 - Episode I: Mission 4 (Mos Espa Pod Race), while still a race, is now one 
  big cohesive area, and instead of reaching a checkpoint before the time 
  runs out, you simply have to beat Sebulba to the end.
 - Episode II: Mission 4 (Gunship Cavalry) has now become free-roaming, much 
  like the vehicle missions in the OT.
 - All LSW missions have a hidden Power Brick, and many incorporate the newer 
  "building", "levers", and "vehicles" concepts from LSW2 in various spots.  
  Also, all LSW Episodes now each have a Bonus section incorporating Super 
  Story, Character Bonus, and Minikit Bonus.
 - In addition to Story and Free Play, there is now a "Challenge" mode for 
  each mission, which has you finding minikit canisters in a certain amount 
  of time.
 - True Jedi now only needs to be reached either on Story or Free Play, no 
  longer both.
 - There is a "Powerup" pickup in missions which can be grabbed to give your 
  character enhanced abilities for a limited time (more info in 3C).
 - There are now a total of 20 Bounty Hunter Challenges.
 - There are additional characters and extras to purchase.
 - There is a Two Player Arcade, used to pit players against each other.
 - There is a "Bonus" lounge in the Cantina, where you can access six special 
  bonus missions.
 - The game has a total of 160 Gold Bricks to find.
 - For the Wii version, you can use the Remote and Nunchuk to manipulate the 
  game as well as the standard controls.
 - The 360 and PS3 versions have online play.  Note that this is a FAQ for the 
  WII VERSION of the game, so I won't be expanding on that much.

 So, bottom line is that there aren't any huge changes, but enough that if a 
 fan is a big Star Wars fan (like me), they could find a lot to love here.

Q: I can't get to a certain spot!  I need Artoo/Threepio/a Jedi/a grappler!  
 What do I do?

A: You'll have to come back to that spot on Free Play, where you can take 
 whatever characters you want.

Q: How can I make studs quickly?

A: First, focus on the multiplier Extras.  Once you snag them, you can 
 apply them to Free Play, and you'll rake in the studs.  Of course, you have 
 to get to them first.
 
 Two missions that give a lot of studs are the Mos Espa Pod Race and the 
 Battle Over Coruscant.  As you crash into poles or shoot down ships, you'll 
 get a great amount.

 Another method that requires a little more patience and an extra controler 
 is to buy the Fertilizer and Poo Money Extras.  Get to an area with two 
 animals and face them back to back with each other, and turn on the Extras.  
 Continually press Z on both Nunchuks and you'll drag in studs indefinitely 
 without having to really watch the game, so you can just watch a movie or 
 something while hitting Z over and over again.

Q: I have all the Gold Bricks and everything, but I still don't have 100%!  
 What am I missing?

A: Most likely, you're missing the Super Stories.  They don't give you Gold 
 Bricks, or any kind of reward, except credit towards your final percentage, 
 so that's probably it.

******************************************************************************
3. BASICS
******************************************************************************

Most of this information can be found in the instruction manual, like anyone 
reads those.

==============
3A. Controls =
==============

General Controls -

Control Stick: Move your character.
A Button: Jump or hover (not available for all characters)
B Button: Attack or use primary ability.
Z Button: Use special ability.  Also used to bulid piles of LEGOs and pull 
 levers (non-droids only).
C Button: Shift focus.  Use when facing another character to transfer control 
 to them.
1 and 2 Buttons: Only used during Free Play.  Switch between characters you 
 selected for this mission.
+ Button: Brings up Pause Menu.

---

Blaster Character Controls -

A Button: Jump.  Some characters have a second diving jump if you press A 
 again.
B Button: Fire blaster.  Press B just as a blaster bolt is about to hit you 
 to dodge it.
Z Button: Use grappling hook on red targets.

---

Jedi/Sith Controls -

A Button: Jump.  Press again for a double jump.
B Button: Swing lightsaber.  Hold down saber to assume blocking position.  
 Press B just as a blaster bolt is about to hit you to reflect it back at 
 its shooter.
Z Button: Use the Force.  Using the Force will have different results 
 depending on the character and target.  Using the Force on any simple 
 object will manipulate it in a predetermined manner (ie. bricks will become 
 stairs).  Using the Force on a droid (and certain others) will push it 
 back, where it will be damaged.  Using the Force on most non-droid enemies 
 will use Mind Trick, stunning them.  Certain characters have a special 
 Force use on enemeis, such as Force Choke or Force Lightning.

There are also some cool moves/combos you can do with a lightsaber.  If you 
jump and attack, you'll perform a jump-slash.  This has a good chance of 
hitting your target, but you're vulnerable while performing it.  If you 
double-jump and attack, you'll perform a diving down-stab.  This will create 
a small outward field that will damage enemies all around you.  Finally, 
there's the standing combo.  If you press the attack button again right 
after you finish your first strike, your second will have sparkly trails.  
Do it again for a third strike, and you'll perform a "super slash", which has 
double power AND can break through an enemy's guard.

---

Flying Vehicle Controls -

Control Stick: Push in the direction you wish to fly.  Push in the opposite 
 direction to perform a U-turn.
A Button: Acrobatics.  Simply press A to perform a loop.  Press A and tap 
 left or right to do a barrel roll and avoid enemy fire.
B Button: Fire blasters.
Z Button: Fire proton torpedoes that you've picked up.

---

Motion Sensor Movements -

None of these are required to do.  You can play the entire game without 
so much as twitching your Nunchuk, but they're available if you wish.

Saber Swing - If your character is armed with a saber, swinging the Remote is 
 the same as pressing B.  It will perform all the attendant saber moves.

Blocking and Dodging - Holding your Wii Remote horizontally will allow you to 
 block with a saber, or dodge incoming shots if you're a gunner.

Force - Moving the Nunchuk left and right as you hold Z will allow you to 
 move things faster through the Force.

Building - Once you start building something (holding down Z), move both the 
 Remote and Nunchuk up and down (as if you were climbing a ladder) and you'll 
 build faster.

Grapple - If your character can use a grapple, stand on a red target and 
 quickly move your Remote upwards to use it.

================
3C. Hints/Tips =
================

The basic form of progress in this game is the "Gold Brick".  You get a 
Gold Brick for completing a mission in Story Mode, for getting True Jedi 
status, and for collecting all Minikit Canisters in a mission.  Also, bonus 
missions have a Gold Brick as the reward for beating the threshold.  There 
are also Bricks you can purchase from the Cantina.  This gives you a grand 
total of 160 Gold Bricks to get.  Lastly, after your 60th Gold Brick, every 
one you get thereafter will get you an additional 100,000 studs.

Keep collecting studs.  Collecting a specified number will give you "True 
Jedi" status and a Gold Brick.  Once you hit the True Jedi threshold, you 
cannot lose it, no matter how low your studs get afterwards.  You only need to 
get True Jedi once for each mission, either on Story or Free Play.

Collect Minikit Canisters (I just refer to them as "canisters") to assemble a 
vehicle.  Collecting all ten and completing the vehicle will give you 50,000 
studs, a Gold Brick, and will allow you to use that vehicle in Minikit bonus 
missions.

Each mission has a red Power Brick in them.  Collect that Power Brick and 
complete the mission to unlock an Extra for purchase at the bar.  Some of 
these can be pretty expensive, mind you, but they're the most useful ones.

Watch for "Powerups", which are blue balls of energy new to this game.  If 
you pick one up, you'll get about fifteen seconds worth of "special powers".  
These include:
- Attacks do double damage (sabers, blasters, melee).
- Your character is invulnerable (attacks won't even faze him, and blaster 
 bolts will bounce off).
- Blindingly fast Force and build times.
- You have a large "stud collection" radius, meaning studs will be pulled to 
 you from further away.  This doesn't work so well against studs you knock 
 out of things until they settle.
- Vehicles will have the "Tractor Beam" power active.
- All studs collected will be multiplied by two.

Shoot.  Freakin'.  Everything.  If it's made out of LEGO bricks and not 
obviously part of the background, gun it down, or saber it down, or whatever 
you have to do, because a lot of stuff to move ahead in the game requires 
you to go on a destruction frenzy.

Explore everywhere.  Run into walls and behind them to look for any areas 
you might be missing.

If you die, you'll drop a portion of your studs: usually 2,000, but that can 
vary if you have Adaptive Difficulty turned on.  You can die as many times as 
you want and you can still finish the mission.  However, losing too many 
studs means you'll have a harder time getting True Jedi status, so be sure to 
recollect those lost studs when you croak.

Sparklies on an object means that you can use the Force on them, so take that 
opportunity whenever it presents itself.  Red sparklies means that ONLY a 
Sith can use the Force on those objects.  Sith aren't purchaseable 
immediately, and are usually quite expensive.

******************************************************************************
4. MOS EISLEY CANTINA
******************************************************************************

This is the main hub in the game.  Lots of characters wander around, and if 
you start a bar fight, look out.  A batch of the characters you've unlocked 
will also be strolling around the place, inside and outside.

Anyway, there are several points of interest in the Cantina:

---

Bar -

This is pretty much where you buy everything in the game.  Just to the left 
is a holoprojector that shows your time playing and your total percentage.  
Walk up to Wuher the bartender to see his menu.

Hints: These are all purchased for 100 studs, except for the last one, which 
 is 1000.  They give you basic tips on how to play the game.

Characters: As you progress through missions, you'll be given characters 
 automatically if you used them in the Story.  For characters you don't play 
 as in the Story, you'll have to purchase them from here as they're unlocked.

Extras: These are gameplay modifiers.  Some help you get through the game.  
 Others are just for show.  Some are available for purchase immediately.  
 Others require you to find Power Bricks to make them available.

Enter Code: If, somehow, you come across secret codes, you can enter them 
 here to quickly unlock stuff that would require you plenty of studs 
 otherwise.

Gold Bricks: There are fourteen Gold Bricks available to buy, starting at 
 10,000, and increasing in price by 5,000.  A new one will become available 
 for every few missions you complete.

Story Clips: Pick this to view any movie clip you've seen during Story Mode.

---

Bacta Tanks -

In these two bacta tanks are your "Create-A-Characters".  Get close and you 
can completely customize two characters to your liking:

Up/Down: Select which part to change.
Left/Right: Cycle through available parts.
A Button: Switch to other character.
B Button: Save and Exit
Z Button: Edit the character's name.
C Button: Random selection.

You can customize the following parts: Hat/Helmet/Hair, Head, Cape, Body, 
Arms, Hands, Weapon, Belt (lower torso), and Legs.  What you choose as the 
weapon and head defines your character's class.  Lightsabers will be Jedi.  
Guns will be gunfighters, etc.  Putting on a stormtrooper helmet or bounty 
hunter helmet/head will give your character that access.  Also, be warned that 
some LEGO heads won't accommodate hats, such as Yoda's.

Note that, initially, you will NOT be able to give your characters powers that 
you do not already have access to in your existing characters.  That is, you 
won't have bounty hunter helmets or red lightsabers to make premature Hunters 
or Sith until you buy them from the bar.

---

Episode Lounges -

These are where you access the respective episodes.  At first, only I is 
open.  After the first mission, the other episodes will be available.  You 
must beat each episode's missions in sequential order.  Hanging outside the 
lounge's gate, or each mission's door will give you your stats on that 
mission/episode so far.  Your first visit to a mission is always Story.  
After that, you can replay the Story, or play on Free Play, or play the 
Challenge.

---

Bonus Lounge -

The bonus area to the right of the episode lounges is where your special 
bonuses lie.  You need Gold Bricks to access these.

---

The Junkyard -

To the far left is the door outside.  There are a few things to play with out 
here, such as a mini-racetrack and a couple of cars to build.  Also, you'll 
find the door to the Bounty Hunter Challenges out here, a minikit viewing 
area, and the 160 Gold Brick bonus, once you get them all.

---

Bounty Hunter Challenges -

Once you purchase the follwing six bounty hunters: Greedo, Boba Fett, IG-88, 
4-LOM, Bossk, and Dengar, you can access this, which is out in the Junkyard.

******************************************************************************
5. STORY WALKTHROUGHS
******************************************************************************

Below you'll find walkthroughs for all the main missions in the game.  These 
walkthroughs take relatively few diversions from the main path, nor do they 
stop to find minikits along the way.  We'll cover all that in the next 
section.

Qui-Gon Jinn
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Gonk Droid: 3,000

 Droideka

True Jedi at 31,000: A piece of cake.  If you turn right as you go in, you'll 
 find a generator that you can use the Force on to get more than half your 
 total.  You can reach your threshold well before the second area.

Area 1: Play with whatever you want in here, then use the Force (Z) on the 
 door to bust it down.  Saber the droids good, then proceed down the hallway.  
 Fight more droids, then bust your way through the canisters.  You'll find 
 TC-14 at the end, so use the C button to switch to her.  Press Z while she 
 stands in front of the panel with a protocol droid face on it to open the 
 door.  In the next room, have one of your Jedi use Z to put together the 
 panel, then have TC-14 use that one.  In the next room, use the Force on 
 the wall grating to remove it.  Chop up the two droids behind it, then 
 press on.

Area 2: There are several droids populating this area.  Note the Powerup in 
 the middle of the room.  This will grant you great power when attacking and 
 in using your special abilities (Force and building go much faster), as 
 well as invincibility and being able to pick up studs from far away.  As you 
 head to the right, you'll find even more Droids.  Smashing them will summon 
 two Droidekas near the force field.  Beating them is a matter of either 
 pounding them until their shields drop, then hitting them three times, or 
 using one diving saber attack to lower their shields first.  Also, there's a 
 STAP in the front of the room that you can put together and use, if you wish.  
 Also, in the orange bricks on the right side, you'll find a Powerup in one 
 of them.  Once the Droidekas are scrap, use the Force on either of the two 
 wall ornaments on the sides of the force field to create platforms.  Hop 
 onto them and over.  Have both Jedi stand on the two buttons (if you're 
 playing alone, the CPU will help you with the other Jedi).  This removes 
 the force field and scares up some more droids.  Waste them, then have TC-14 
 use the panel here.  Enter the transport that just opened and you're done!  
 Yes, already!

"You almost got us killed.  Are you brainless?" - Qui-Gon

Starting Characters: Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi
Added Characters: Jar Jar Binks
Enemies: Battle Droid

True Jedi at 44,000: Shouldn't be too hard.  Studs are pretty easy to come 
 by, and obvious to find.

Area 1: Your path is straight ahead.  Droids, Gungans, and others will 
 migrate across your path from the left to the right.  Some of the droids 
 will decide to mix it up with you, so oblige them.  Eventually, you'll come 
 upon a fallen tree.  Force it up to be able to move on.  Next, a droid 
 transport will be blocking your path.  Use the Force on the lit-up part of 
 it several times to make it explode.  Continue on and you'll find Jar Jar 
 stopping to smell the flowers.  With him in tow, head up the stone steps.  
 The mob will cease at this point, so continue to the next area.

Area 2: Force the Gungan face into a bridge, then cross.  Switch to Jar Jar 
 on the other side, then use his high double jump to reach the top of the 
 stone, dropping it down to your level.  This will uncover a mechanism that 
 you will need to use the Force on to lower another platform.  Switch back to 
 Jar Jar and hop on three more platforms.  You'll have to leave that green 
 circle for later, as you don't have any bounty hunters.  Press on to the 
 right and the exit.

Area 3: Remove the Force-sensitive blocks above you to release a ramp.  
 Climb up and fight your way along to the swamp area and beyond to a second 
 swamp.  Switch to Jar Jar and have him jump up to the high ledge, following 
 the stud trail.  At the end, he can stand on a darker stone to make it sink, 
 revealing the passage to the next area.

Area 4: There's not much to this area except to press straight ahead and 
 follow the stud arrow into the water to finish the mission.

True Jedi at 48,000: This will probably take until the last area.  Make sure 
 you focus on everything that can be blown.  Don't ignore windows, either.  
 Once you get the Jedi back, use the Force on things before smashing them.

Area 1: While the Jedi saved the Queen's butt, they apparently are needed 
 somewhere else (probably the john), so you'll be controlling your first 
 gunfighters, here.  Shoot all droids in the area.  Your destination is the 
 back left corner, where you'll find a red target you can use as a starting 
 point to grapple up to the next level (hit Z).  Move right along the balcony 
 to find another grapple point to ride up.  Move right from there, past the 
 windows, and blow up a flower bed to find yet another grapple point.  Blast 
 the droids here, and a nearby flower bed for the next point.  At the top, 
 you'll see a big puzzle, but you can't complete it at the moment, so just 
 blast all the bad guys and move on to the back right.

Area 2: Go straight ahead and blast all the droids in your path and head out 
 the doorway.

Area 3: Go down the steps and blast your way out through the windows.  Head 
 to the right and shoot the red and yellow target near the gate to open it.  
 Go through.

Area 4: Drop down to the lower level and rejoin your Jedi-folk.  Once all the 
 droids are scrap, head to the right.  You'll run across another squad of 
 droids, which are near some canisters.  Two of these canisters are on top of 
 elevators, so blast them to start them moving.  Take a gunner onto the 
 elevators and blast the targets as they come in range.  Once all four targets 
 are hit, you can go through the gate.

Area 5: Cross over the bridge to the rooftops.  Now, in addition to a bunch 
 of marching droid patrols, you'll notice the main area has three big 
 skylights, each with a button on the top.  These buttons remove the smaller 
 skylights on the edges of the roof.  Each button removes one skylight from 
 each side.  The button you want to hit is the middle one, then head to the 
 back of the roof and remove the grating over the hole.  Fall down to finish.

"Better stop you friend's betting, or I'll end up owning him, too." - Watto, 
 translated from Huttese

Vehicles: Anakin's Pod

True Jedi at 46,000: This is a little tricky, because you'll have to run 
 into just about everything out here.  Just about all the poles and crystals 
 have studs in them, and you need to run into them to scare the studs out.

Area 1: Here's how it goes.  Remember the old LSW where it was a bunch of 
 smaller areas and you had to reach a "checkpoint" before time ran out?  Not 
 so much, anymore.  The whole race is now one big area, and all you have to 
 do is beat Sebulba to the end.  That said, it's still a wild and fast race, 
 with lots of hazards, so you still have to stay awake.  Hit the boost pads 
 whenever you can to get an edge.  Also, if you blow up, you'll simply 
 start where you were at, not the beginning of the "checkpoint".

 The first lap is relatively tame, except for the big canyon, where you'll 
 have Tusken Raiders gunning down at you.  Try to avoid their shots to take 
 as little damage as possible.

 In the second lap, the path switches after a crash, so you'll need to 
 navigate a new area, although there isn't much else new to it.

 In the final lap, the big canyon has rocks in addition to shots firing.  
 These rocks won't destroy you (like they used to), but they will slow you 
 down.

True Jedi at 60,000: This one's a tall order, as there aren't a lot of big 
 stud dumps in this mission.  Just shoot everything that looks shootable, and 
 make sure you try to Force it first.

Area 1: With your largest cast, yet, head into the main plaza and start 
 causing havoc.  Take down all the droids and blow up the tank.  This will 
 allow you to Force together a ramp, which you need for Artoo so he can get 
 up on the upper level.  Go to the back of the room and use Artoo on the 
 door to open it.

Area 2: Use the Force on the hook, and on the blocks.  This will basically 
 create means for all six characters to cross this gap by their own methods.  
 Go to the next area.  Destroy the droids and Droidekas, then step on one of 
 the buttons.  All your other characters will step on them, as well, which 
 will open the doors to your right.  Take out the droids and press on.  In 
 the next circular room, blow up the statue and assemble the Artoo panel 
 it reveals.  Use it, then head through the door.

Area 3: Head left, then up and waste the droids.  In this fountain area, 
 you'll find some blocks near the fountain to the right.  Force them into 
 steps so you can climb up to the upper ledges, where you can Force together a 
 bridge going left.  Artoo will find his own way to you, so continue to the 
 left until you reach a gate.  Remove the nearby flower bed and step on the 
 switch to reveal a vent.  Send Anakin through it so he can get to the back 
 area.  If you hadn't done so, use Jedi to remove the big boxes so Anakin can 
 reach another vent and then the switch to open the gate.

Area 4: Destroy all the droids in this area.  The point of this place is to 
 create the means for all the characters to get to the gate in the upper 
 right.  The blocks on the right end can be Forced together into an elevator 
 for Artoo.  To the left of that is a flower bed, under which is a grapple 
 point for the gunners.  A vent on the back wall is all ready for Anakin.  
 Now, the Jedi.  Go to the left side of the area to find two boxes.  Have each 
 Jedi stand on the box and you can both use the Force to raise each other to 
 the top.  From there, Force the nearby ledge up and you can all go to the 
 right to the six buttons in front of the gate to open it.

Area 5: Head straight across this large hall and up the stairs on the right 
 into the alcove with a Droideka.  There are three statues here covering 
 buttons.  The ones on the left and right release enemies, while the back one 
 will open the way ahead.

Area 6: You're now in the hangar, and the object is to free six pilots.  
 For starters, there are two right on the ground floor in the middle of the 
 room.  Blast the two red-marked droids to free them.  There are two more 
 higher up in the middle of the room.  Do the two-box-lift trick you did 
 earlier to get your Jedi up there to free the pilots.  To get the one above 
 the door you entered by, go to the left and put together a three-block tower, 
 using the biggest one as the base, of course, then hop around the ledges 
 along the walls to reach above the door.  The last pilot in the far left 
 corner is freed by another three-block tower just near it.  Once all six are 
 loose, go to the far right corner and use the Artoo panel to end the mission.

"We'll handle this." - Qui-Gon

Starting Characters: Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi
Enemies: Battle Droid, Battle Droid (Commander), Droideka, Darth Maul

True Jedi at 31,000: Not too hard.  Most of your studs will be found in 
 Area 1 and Area 3.  Just make sure to explore all the nooks and crannies.

Area 1: Time for some Maul-tastic action.  First thing's first.  You need 
 to get that bridge down.  Start by reflecting blaster bolts from the droids.  
 Remember to press B just before the blaster bolt hits you to reflect it 
 directly back at the droid.  Once all four are scrap, Maul will try to throw 
 something at you.  Use the Force on it quickly to send it back at him, which 
 will knock off a heart.  Hit him three times like this and he'll drop the 
 bridge and run.  Force it back together and head after him.

Area 2: Follow Maul as he flips around the catwalks.  Jump up and give chase.  
 When he goes across a large gap, use the Force to pull out a platform, then 
 quickly cross it before it recedes back into the wall.  Continue like this.  
 If you fall, you'll have to go back to the beginning to get back up.  Once 
 you reach the end, follow him into the next room.

Area 3: As you jump across the platforms to give chase, Maul will drop the 
 last platform leading to him.  To get this back up, first you need to go to 
 the left and right.  There is a Commander Battle Droid on each end, calling 
 down loads of Battle Droids, so smash both of them.  Once the area is 
 cleared of all the droids, two platforms with Droidekas on them will rise.  
 Trash them and step on the switches to raise the platform to the far end.

Area 4: The way through this is for each Jedi to hit each lever to pass 
 through the force fields.  It's pretty simple.

Area 5: It's party time.  Duel him so he's down two hearts, then he'll 
 start jumping around.  Use a jump strike or a down stab to hurt him.  When 
 he's down to four hearts, he'll hop onto the nearby platforms and start 
 flinging stuff at you.  Catch those objects and Force them back at him to 
 knock him off the platforms, then saber him some more until you drain his 
 hearts.

"What took you so long?" - Obi-Wan
"Oh, you know, Master.  I couldn't find a speeder I really liked." - Anakin

Vehicles: Anakin's Speeder
Enemies: Zam's Speeder

True Jedi at 45,000: Shoot everything.  All the signs.  Anything that can 
 be blown up.  Be methodical.

Area 1: Whoa!  A brand new mission!  Here, you need to chase down Zam 
 Wesell.  Both you and Obi-Wan will be in a speeder.  Basically, all you 
 need to do is follow the path, while not being shot down.  There are guns 
 that will try to shoot you down as you chase Zam, but overall, there's not 
 much to focus on besides the chase.  Shoot down signs, etc. for studs if 
 you wish.  Follow Zam through a traffic tunnel and out the other side.

Area 2: Zam will shoot behind her and trap you between force fields.  You 
 now need to bust down the force field generators in order to leave.  First, 
 gun down any and all turrets shooting at you, then you need to fly over 
 two spots that are glowing with light.  Once you run over both of them, 
 the torpedo dispenser will appear.  Grab torpedoes and start firing at the 
 yellow and gray generators on either side of the back force field.  Once 
 you take down all six generators with torps, the force field will drop and 
 you can move on.

Area 3: This is another chase section.  Not much different from the last one.  
 Keep up the pursuit.

Area 4: This is another force field section, only you've got twelve generators 
 to take down, an equal number of turrets, and you need to fly over four 
 glowing spots to uncover the torpedo dispenser.  If you get lucky and find a 
 powerup, take it and lay waste to the area before you go boom.  Anyway, 
 blast away all the generators.

Area 5: Now, it's a flying laser duel.  You basically need to down Zam's 
 speeder.  It's not too difficult.  Just turn away if she starts shooting 
 and try to get behind her.  Once you drain the speeder's hearts, you'll 
 finish the mission.

5H. Discovery on Kamino =

"I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe." - Jango Fett

Starting Characters: Obi-Wan Kenobi (Jedi Master), R4-P17
Enemies: Floating Gun Pods, Gun Turrets, Jango Fett, Slave I

True Jedi at 50,000: Not too hard, as there are a lot blue studs dotted 
 around.  I hit this just after finding Jango (raiding his room).

Area 1: As you enter the area, you'll see lightning strike one of the... 
 uh... "things", that the Kaminoan was working on.  Force it back together 
 and the bridge will extend, letting you inside.

Area 2: Follow Taun We into the next room.

Area 3: In this next room, the puzzle is to step on all the lights in the 
 center of the room.  Once they're all lit, the door behind Taun We will 
 open.  Follow her into the next hall and have R4 open the door.

Area 4: Continue to follow Taun We into the next room.

Area 5: Jango will take off.  Smash all the Gun Pods, then follow him.

Area 4: Reflect the blasts from the Turrets back at them, then chase Jango.

Area 6: Jump down the hatch after Jango.

Area 7: Jango will now set bombs in your path.  The idea is to get close 
 enough to set them off, then to back away.  The path will be broken by the 
 explosion, so you'll have to jump the gaps.  When you reach the end, step on 
 the red button to extend a small ledge, then have R4 float across and step 
 on the red button on the far side.  When he gets to the far side, have Obi-
 Wan use the Force on the stuff to the left of the door to uncover the Artoo 
 panel.  Unlock it and enter.

Area 8: As you advance, you'll find that two hatches on the upper-right are 
 spewing Gun Pods.  There's a Powerup to the left of the elevator you came 
 in on if you want to use it, but the real trick is to switch to R4 have him 
 use the two panels near the hatches to close them, otherwise the Gun Pods 
 will continue spilling out.  Wipe up the remaining Pods and use the Force on 
 the wreckage to remove it.  Activate the Artoo panel and proceed.

Area 9: Time for the fight with Jango AND the Slave I, driven by Boba.  
 Either run up and smack him, or reflect his blasts back at him to hurt him.  
 When you've knocked him down to seven, he'll fire up the jetpack, meaning 
 you'll know be forced to reflect his blasts, and the Slave I will start 
 firing at you.  To stop this ruckus, have R4 activate any of the panels, 
 which will fire up a gun that will blast the Slave I to stop it for a short 
 while while it fires back.  Once Jango's down to four hearts, he'll switch to 
 his missiles.  Use the Force on them to direct them back at him.  Do this 
 until he's down to one heart and he'll just run away from you.  Chase him 
 down and deliver the final blow.

Added Characters: R2-D2, C-3PO
Enemies: Geonosian, Battle Droid (Geonosis), Droideka

True Jedi at 40,000: Shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Plenty of blues 
 lying around.  Just be careful not to fall too much.

Area 1: As you enter the hive area, you'll be attacked by several Geonosians.  
 Crush them and press on.

Area 2: The ledge here will retract once you stand on it, but you probably 
 want to drop down, anyway.  Be careful on the front flaps of this conveyor 
 belt, as they will drop you if you stand on them.  Move to the right, 
 watching out for nasty pistons that will squash you.  Smash the Droideka and 
 continue to the right.  You'll find Artoo, shortly.  Just past his spot (and 
 a few droids), you'll find some fans you can Force together that will lift 
 you up.  Let them carry you to the higher ledge on the far right, then go 
 through the doorway.

Area 3: Switch to Padmé.  Have her grapple up to the upper ledge and shoot 
 the target to raise a big bucket, then cross over and grapple up to another 
 target.  This will get the big bucket moving.  Hop on and it will drop you 
 on the next ledge.  Bust away the canisters and Force the target onto the 
 wall so you can shoot it.  Now two more buckets are moving to your right.  
 Keep going to the right to a solid platform.  Now, you have to hop onto a 
 bucket and then off before it moves past some blue flames, then cross another 
 gap to the door.  Have Artoo open it and pass through.

Area 4: Hi, Threepio.  The objective of this area is to get him across.  Your 
 other three characters can manage just fine, but Threepio will need to be 
 carried by the platforms in the middle of the room.  Hop onto them with 
 Anakin and rotate them using the Force.  Threepio will cross onto them when 
 he is able to, so keep rotating so he gets to the other side and open the 
 door with him.

Area 5: Proceed to the right in this cavernous area, dealing with any 
 Geonosians that give you trouble.  After you pass under an arch, have 
 Padmé grapple up to the upper ledge and shoot the bricks on the far right.  
 Have Anakin Force them into a platform, then float across them to the right 
 with Artoo.  Use the Artoo panel to extend a bridge so everyone can get to 
 the right and waste the Droidekas.  Use the Threepio panel and enter the 
 door.

Area 6: Have Artoo use the right-hand panel to roll a bomb out.  Force it 
 over to the force field and blast (or saber) it to blow both up.  Take the 
 Powerup that's left behind and head to the right.  Quickly take care of 
 all the droids, Geonosians, and Droidekas before it expires.  Once they're 
 all scrap, use the Force on each of Obi-Wan's four restraints to free him.

Enemies: Geonosian, Battle Droid (Geonosis), Battle Droid (Security), 
 Super Battle Droid, Droideka, Jango Fett

True Jedi at 8,000: A rather low amount, given that there is only one small 
 area to work with, anyway.  Just quickly search the perimeter and you 
 should get enough in short order.

Area 1: Okay, this whole level is just one area.  The idea here is to first 
 free the captives.  To do so, you need to blast the enemies guarding them.  
 First is Padmé, guarded by five Security Droids and two Droidekas.  Force 
 her down once they're all toast.  Next is Anakin, guarded by five Supers and 
 two Droidekas.  Lastly is Obi-Wan, guarded by two Supers and five Droidekas.  
 It should be noted that most of the bombs in the area have Powerups inside 
 if you want to risk blowing them (and yourself) up.  Don't be ashamed to 
 grab one if things are getting ugly.

 All right, once all three of your chums are free, the battle begins in 
 earnest.  Enemies will start coming out of the gate, and you need to take 
 out those enemies specifically to move on.  Taking out the pinkish battle 
 droids and the Geonosians won't get you anywhere.  Focus on the specified 
 enemies.  The first wave is six Security Droids.  The second is three Security 
 Droids and three Supers.  Now, Jango will drop down and attack.  Fight him 
 the same as you did two missions ago.  Deflect his blasts at him while he's 
 in the air, and Force the missiles he fires back at him.

"No, I call it aggressive negotiations." - Padmé

Vehicles: Republic Gunship
Enemies: Spider Droid, Hailfire Droid, Techno Union Ship, Turbolaser

True Jedi at 30,000: You're probably going to die a lot in this mission, so 
 try to avoid that.  Don't worry too much about studs early on: the Techno 
 Union ships don't give you that much.  Your real bank comes from the second 
 area, blowing up turbolasers and whatever it is they're guarding.

Area 1: Hey!  This is different.  This area is now free-roaming, as opposed 
 to on-rails as it was in LSW.  Blast everything, duh.  The things you can't 
 blast, sadly, are the turbolasers that basically form the "wait and then go" 
 policy of this area.  At the halfway point, you'll see a force field.  You'll 
 need to go back and to the left to find a bomb dispenser.  Use Z to latch 
 your tow cable onto the bomb and drag one to each of the two generators next 
 to the field.  You'll do the same thing in the next area, only you'll have 
 to drag the bombs through a bunch of turbolasers, making life a pain.

Area 2: Now, you need to bring down the Trade Federation Control Ship.  To 
 do this, you need to blow up all the Turbolasers guarding it with bombs.  
 Blowing up to adjacent turbolasers will remove the blue shields from the... 
 whatevers, and you can shoot them up.  Do this for all four sides to complete 
 this area.  Oh, and shooting up those things will get you a Powerup, so take 
 advantage of the invincibility to quickly bomb the next two turbolasers.

Area 1: Chase after Dooku.  Take down any droids and Geonosians that get in 
 your way.  Once he hides behind a door, go to the right.  Step on the red 
 button on the floor and your partner will step on a button you revealed, 
 revealing another button, etc.  Continue this until you both reach the top 
 ledge above the door and both of you can Force the levers down to open the 
 door and pass through.

Area 2: Duel Dooku down to seven hearts, where he will retreat to the right 
 side and surround himself with a "repulsion" field.  You'll now need to 
 Force things that he throws at you back at him.  Do this three times and 
 he'll take Anakin out of the fight, and you'll take over with Yoda.  Hit 
 him three more times and he'll retreat again to the right side.  This time, 
 he'll use lightning.  You need to switch characters when he does this so 
 you won't be hurt, and then hit him with your free character.  Do this 
 three times, then you'll be able to resume the duel once more, so finish 
 him off.

True Jedi at 75,000: Seems like a tall order, but there are dozens of 
 fighters flying around that could help you reach your goal.  Just keep 
 shooting.  You get a nice big concentration of fighters in the latter 
 half, so take advantage of it.

Area 1: This mission is only slightly changed from the original.  You'll 
 have your barrel rolls, but you're still on rails, so just hang on for the 
 ride.  Basically, shoot anything that shoots back.  After passing two 
 cruisers, you'll turn directly towards a third, with five red circles on 
 it.  Shoot all five to bust the cruiser so you can fly through.  You'll 
 fly around some more shooting up enemies, then pass low over the top of a 
 cruiser.  You need to shoot two red circles on the ship's bridge tower so 
 you can keep going past it.  Soon afterwards, you'll have to blast two 
 circles on either side of a cruiser to open the hangar doors so you can 
 pass through.  After some more flying, you'll finally come up on Grievous' 
 ship, the Invisible Hand.  As you close in on it, shoot the red circles on 
 either side of the shield to drop it, and you'll fly right in.

Enemies: Battle Droid (Security), Battle Droid, Battle Droid (Commander), 
 Super Battle Droid, Droideka, Count Dooku, Grievous' Bodyguard

True Jedi at 60,000: I had few problems with this.  One thing to point out 
 is a generator in Area 2 that spills a bunch of studs.  It's guarded by a 
 Droideka.

Area 1: Head straight up.  Grievous will send some droids out, so trash 
 them and Force the door apart.

Area 2: Drop down and smash all the droids down here, then use the Force 
 in the far area to create two ledges so you can jump to the upper area.  
 Use the Force on the yellow grates (either one) and continue through the 
 tunnel.

Area 3: Push through the droids and Droidekas and go right.  After cleaning 
 out this area, Artoo will pop up out of one of the doors.  Use him to open 
 the door on the furthest right to find a crate.  Force that crate to the 
 next room, then Force it again to blow it up, creating a new path.

Area 4: Head to the right and jump up to the ledges.  You'll see a wall panel 
 that you can Force, so do so to create a ledge.  Hop up to the valve above 
 and Force it to create an air flow to your right that will lift you up to 
 the top ledge.  Crush the Droideka, and have Artoo use the nearby panel to 
 go through.

Area 5: Time for your rematch against Dooku.  He's much simpler this time.  
 Duel him as normal, and if you uses Lightning on you, switch to your 
 partner so he can hit Dooku.  After six hearts, Dooku's in pieces, and 
 you can now leave by the upper door.  Go straight ahead into the elevator 
 shaft.

Area 6: Yes, you're on your side, and yes, that's an elevator chasing you.  
 You're now running down the wall.  Run and run until you hit the end.  Avoid 
 the holes because they're actually vents that slam you into the ceiling.  
 It's easiest to hug the left-hand wall and you'll be safe.  The elevator will 
 stop before the end, and you can leave by the door.  If you want to go back 
 and collect studs, you can use the Artoo panel to raise the elevator.

Area 7: Go through this area, then to the ledge on your left.  There are 
 several spots you can Force for studs, but your first obstacle is a bunch 
 of steam jets blocking your path.  Have Artoo go through them and activate 
 the panel on the other side so everyone can get through, then have him 
 hit the panel at the end of the room.

Area 8: You'll face off against two of Grievous' Bodyguards.  Duel them as 
 you would saber-wielders and continue on to the bridge.  Bust down all 
 the droids, then use the Force on one of the levers and your other Jedi 
 will use it on the other lever.

True Jedi at 3,500: A piddling amount, but studs are pretty hard to come by 
 here, especially on Story.  There aren't any really hidden, either.

Area 1: Knock one heart off Grievous and he'll jump to the far left.  Switch 
 to Cody and have him shoot the two bombs near Grievous, which will knock off 
 another heart.  Duel two more hearts off him, and he'll jump to the back.  
 Force the bridge together, then climb up to the right (double jump and 
 grapple, respectively).  Once on the next ledge, use the force to bring 
 some bricks down, then hop onto them as Cody so you can jump and shoot the 
 bomb near Grievous.  Go back to the middle and duel him down to three 
 hearts.  He'll now jump to the back right.  Head back to the ledges and 
 you can Force together some steps.  Climb up and Force a bomb over to near 
 Grievous.  Shoot it and he'll jump back to the middle.  Follow him and 
 finish him off.

"Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have." - Yoda

Starting Characters: Yoda, Chewbacca
Added Characters: Wookiee
Enemies: Battle Droid, Battle Droid (Commander), Clone, Clone Commander (two 
 hearts), AT-XT Walker

True Jedi at 65,000: A decent goal, but doable, if you fight smart and try 
 to stay alive.  You won't get too much from the early parts.  I'll just 
 tell you that, now.  I got most of it from the third and fourth areas.

Area 1: Use the Force on the two lights near the bridge to lower it, then 
 cross.  As you make your way around the tree to the next platform, Order 
 66 will be issued, and you'll have to plow down all these Clones.  Once 
 you do that, Force the lights near the bridge to lower it.  Now, you'll 
 have to free three Wookiees so you can move ahead.  Move the nearest tree.  
 For the first one, grapple up using Chewie, then around to the left.  
 You'll reach a spot with two Clones, so blast them to free the Wookiee.  
 Now, drop back down and head to the right.  A bridge here goes to a new 
 platform.  Once you deal with the Clones, go to the right.  Force together 
 a Grapple Point and grapple up to the second captured Wookiee.  Free him, 
 then go back down to the left, and then to the back area, where the third 
 Wookiee is very obviously being held.  Free him, and all five of you can 
 go further down the bridge to the buttons which will lower the bridge out 
 of this area.

Area 2: This place is dangerous.  Droids and Clones are flooding the area.  
 Your best strategy is just to keep moving to the left so you stay alive.  
 Use Chewie to shoot the Clone out of the AT-XT Walker, then climb in 
 yourself.  Keep moving left and try not to draw too much attention to 
 yourself.  As you reach the end, Force the suspension bridge on the ground 
 into position, then Force the plant that's just to the left of the bridge to 
 find a Grapple Point.  Grapple up to the top, then shoot the two targets to 
 lower the bridge to get out of this mess.

Area 3: In this area are several Battle Droids being called down by 
 Commanders.  The Commanders are up on the rocks, so take Chewie to shoot them 
 down from a distance.  Alternatively, if you don't feel like exploring this 
 area, you can always just beat cheeks for the far end.

Area 4: Cut down more Clones and press on along the path.  As it winds 
 around, you'll face another AT-XT, so gun it down from a distance, then 
 head to the corner at the end.  Remove two plants with the Force to reveal 
 some platforms leading up to the ledges.  Watch out for boulders (you can 
 shoot or Force them) and continue to the very end.  Force together a 
 platform, then step on the two switches to open the gate.  Blast the 
 Walker on the other side to unseat the Clone, then clean up the rest of the 
 area and move to the left.  You're in the last area, now, so use the Force 
 on all four corners of this little hole, then smash the little modules.  
 Yoda's ship will rise up, so use the Force on it and you'll hop on.

"Killed not by clones, this Padawan.  By a lightsaber, he was." - Yoda

Starting Characters: Obi-Wan Kenobi (Episode III), Yoda
Enemies: Disguised Clone, Clone

True Jedi at 75,000: This is actually quite a tall order.  This is better 
 done in Free Play where you have access to more areas.

Area 1: Run to the right and saber all the Clones.  Continue up the steps and 
 Force open the doors to the Temple.  Enter.

Area 2: Head forward and saber the clones.  Use the Force on the red pillar 
 to turn it into steps and climb up to some more Clones.  Jump off to the 
 right and head to the right (you can go down the steps to the Council Room, 
 but it's unimportant).  Use the Force on the red pillars to find some 
 gears.  Have both Jedi use the Force on the gears to open the door to the 
 next area.

Area 3: Walk ahead in this room, watching for Clone ambushes on either side.  
 In the main room, you need to go to each of the little alcoves on the right, 
 Force platforms so you can jump on them, and Force the lever at the top to 
 add power to the room.  Most of the climbs are relatively straightforward.  
 For the one that has a force field in the way, just pull out a higher 
 platform so you can step on the switch on top.  Once all three are lit, 
 the moving arm moves away from the door and you can press on.

Area 4: Saber all the Clones, then use the Force on the little archive slot 
 to finish this mission.

"You were the Chosen One!!" - Obi-Wan

Starting Characters: Obi-Wan Kenobi (Episode III), Anakin Skywalker (Jedi)

True Jedi at 26,000 - You'll get most of your studs in the second area.  
 Make sure you have a decent amount.  Probably around 20,000 would be best 
 before moving on.

Area 1: This mission's kinda weird, as the two of you are trying to kill 
 each other, but help each other at the same time.  Of course, it's because 
 they needed two characters, so let's play it out.  Anyway, quickly run to 
 the south.  The camera's in a lousy place, so you need to watch closely to 
 make it across the jumps over the lava, or you'll fall in and have to 
 restart.

Area 2: That timer is how much time you have before the area collapses on 
 you.  You can extend this by Forcing the pillars in the middle to hold up 
 the roof.  What you need to do is go to the right side and Force away all 
 the beams blocking the door.  Once all four are gone, have both Jedi Force 
 the door open.

Area 3: You need to go right.  First, smash the two orange containers and 
 have both of you step on the buttons underneath.  Run right.  Force the 
 valve near the steam jet and your partner will go to the other side and 
 Force another valve to hold it open for you.  In the next part, both of you 
 need to Force the two red nodules onto the blue thing, then Force it into the 
 wall to extend a platform.  Get on it.

Area 4: Hop across these platforms.  The square platforms will sink if you 
 stand on them too much, so move quickly to the big vertical beam in the 
 back.  Wait for it to fall down, then hop over so you reach the rocky 
 shore.

Area 5: It's clobberin' time.  Both you and Anakin have ten hearts.  This 
 is kind of fun in two-player.  The best way to destroy Anakin is to just 
 down-stab him over and over again.  Once he's drained, you're done.

5S. Secret Plans =

"Darth Vader.  Only you would be so bold." - Leia

Starting Characters: Princess Leia, Captain Antilles
Added Characters: C-3PO, R2-D2, Rebel Friend
Enemies: Stormtrooper, Imperial Shuttle Pilot, Beach Trooper

True Jedi at 28,000: Should be no prob, Bob, especially if you blow all the 
 walls out of the ship.

Area 1: You start in the data room on the ship.  Assemble both piles to open 
 the door leading out.  You can play with the lever on the left wall to get 
 some silver studs (infinitely, if you're really patient).  In the next room, 
 you both need to pull the levers at roughly the same time.  If playing by 
 yourself, the computer controlled character will help on his own.  Once you 
 open the door, note the Rebels headed to the left.  To your right is where 
 they came from, but the door shuts, and those red sparklies mean only a Sith 
 can access it.  Note that just about any wall in the ship can be blown up for 
 studs, so keep pounding on them.  Follow the Rebels and you'll come upon a 
 door that stormtroopers will burn down.  Gun down all the troopers that 
 attack.  Head into the next area.

Area 2: Grapple up to the top and assemble the two structures to extend the 
 bridge and move on.

Area 3: Well, lookie.  It's the big man himself.  Vader won't allow you to 
 get close to him, and he'll rally up some troops to gun you down.  What you 
 need to do is have both characters pull the levers on one side.  This will 
 release an explosive container near Vader.  Do the same for the other side.  
 Now, shoot up those containers.  Vader will get spooked (I guess) and leave, 
 and you can proceed.  There's not much to do in the next room.  You can only 
 get one of those weird grape bricks, and you can't access the green door 
 until Free Play.  Go to the left and gun down all the troopers that are in 
 this room, and the ones that show up.  You can't access the white circle 
 without being a stormtrooper.  That's another one to come back to on Free 
 Play.  You can, however, pull the levers on the left and right side of the 
 room for studs or to view a humorous scene.  Otherwise, move ahead.

Area 4: Now, the idea of this room is to push each of the two blocks onto 
 the red dots.  Note that you can only move the blocks inside their areas.  
 Once both are in place, the door will open.  Take out the troopers, then 
 walk up to C-3PO.  Have him use his panel and then you'll remove the force 
 field.  You'll now also have R2-D2, but the Princess will leave.  At this 
 point, you could go back to the panels previous that had a Threepio or Artoo 
 on them, but it's not necessary, nor rewarding at this point, so press on.  
 Have Artoo open the panel at the end of the corridor to the next area.

Area 5: You're on one side of a pit.  On the other is another Rebel having 
 it out with some stormies.  What you need to do is go over to the crane and 
 hop in using C.  Move the crane over a trooper and press B or Z to pick him 
 up.  Drop the trooper down the hole in the middle of the room, then do the 
 same for the other.  "Rebel Friend" will then pull a lever allowing you to 
 cross to his side, and he'll also join your cause.  Now, we're not quite 
 done using the crane, yet.  See how Threepio just went over to the other 
 side on his own?  Note the Threepio panel on the door.  Everyone else can 
 cross the gap to the panel, but not Threepio, so you have to lift him with 
 the crane, then drop him in front of the door.  Head on over there yourself 
 and activate the panel.

Area 6: Shoot the troopers to free some buds, then be prepared for an attack 
 by troopers and shuttle pilots.  Press on through the door (don't worry 
 about the flower behind the wall, you can't get all three, yet).  Go into 
 the corridor and assemble the little walkway across the gap.  Continue and 
 build another little walkway.  You're finally at the escape pods.  There are 
 two doors with Artoo panels, and another with a Threepio panel, but it's 
 blocked.  Have Artoo use the two panels and beat the enemies inside (including 
 the creepy-looking Beach Troopers o_O).  Pull the levers in these pods to 
 open the Threepio panel.  Have him use the panel, then guide Artoo in and 
 have him use the panel inside to finish the level.

=================================

"The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly." - Obi-Wan

Starting Characters: Luke Skywalker (Tatooine), Ben Kenobi
Added Characters: C-3PO, R2-D2
Enemies: Jawa, Tusken Raider, Sandtrooper

True Jedi at 60,000: Shouldn't be too much of a pain, but make sure to 
 look for spots in the Sandcrawler than can be destroyed.  You have a Jedi, 
 so use the Force on anything sparkly.

Area 1: As you may have guessed, this is playing out a little differently 
 from how the movie goes.  Instead of Artoo running off, Jawas grab the droids 
 and Luke and Ben have to get them back.  You'll start in a canyon.  You can 
 play around on the banthas if you want, but they're a very lame vehicle, and 
 you're very vulnerable to Tusken attacks on them.  Your main objective is off 
 to the right.  Blast or saber away the bricks under a rock outcropping to 
 lower it, then hop up and further down the causeway.  In the next large 
 desert area, remember to use the Force first, then blast if you want the 
 max possible studs out of something.  Your objective is the crashed escape 
 pod on the hillside.  Using the Force on it will turn it into a ramp up the 
 slippery slope.  Climb up it to move on.

Area 2: Assemble the box in front of you, and either blast or deflect the 
 Tuskens on the ledge.  Push the box all the way to the forward side and hop 
 up to the ledge, then across to the next one, then down to safe ground.  
 Continue up the slope to find the Jawa Sandcrawler.  After clearing the area 
 of debris, you'll find you can Force a couple of blocks into a stack, and 
 build a grapple point.  Also, you can use the Force on one of the walls to 
 open the flap.  Grapple up to the lever and pull it so Ben can get up, then 
 use the Force to pull down another flap, then grapple and double jump up to 
 that spot and pull the lever to get a lift moving nearby.  Hop on and ride 
 to the top.  Pull both levers and you'll activate the droid-sucking tube at 
 the bottom.  Drop down and jump up into the tube.

Area 3: We're inside now.  Just around the corner is a locked door.  Blast 
 away the coverings on the valves, then use the Force on the five of them on 
 the right to open the door.  Use the Force on the rest to release two blue 
 studs.  Head through to the next room.  Pull the lever to release a box which 
 you can push on the recessed area.  Put it on any red square and it will blow 
 up.  You can use this in four places to free a canister, several blue studs, 
 and R2-D2, your objective.  Use Artoo on the panel on the door to open the 
 lift. 

Area 4: In this small area, you simply have to run over each set of four 
 buttons in relatively quick succession.  Doing so will raise two levers.  
 Pull them both and you'll open the door to the next area. 

Area 5: Subdue the Jawas here so they don't zap Artoo (he's out for few 
 seconds when that happens).  Push the rotator switch in the middle counter-
 clockwise until the gray module is above C-3PO's cage.  Once it's lit up, 
 have Artoo access the panel to get him out.  Now that you have Threepio, you 
 can go back to an early part of the Sandcrawler (where you can assemble a 
 Threepio panel) and access an extra room for a ton of studs.  Useful if 
 you're going for True Jedi.  Anyway, have Threepio hit the panel in this room 
 near the door to the left and go through it.  Use the Force on all four 
 supports on the big ramp to lower it.  You may now leave the Sandcrawler.

Area 6: Okay, here's the deal out here.  There's quicksand mud puddles all 
 over the place.  Your job is to operate vaporators to make it safe to cross.  
 You ready?  Take out all the Tuskens you can see, then have Threepio access 
 the nearest vaporator (front right of the area) to harden the sand.  Walk 
 across the sand to the pile and assemble a ramp for Threepio to climb up to 
 the next vaporator.  Once that's operated, you can proceed to the next area.  
 There's a nice big chasm to cross, and Ben's your man.  Hop up on the rock 
 ledges to the left and you'll see bricks attached to the wall.  Force those 
 into a nice bridge.  Cross and you'll see a rather obvious pushable box up a 
 few ledges.  Drop that off the back end of the ledge, then Force it into a 
 bridge to the next vaporator.  This will allow you to continue on to the 
 end of the area.

Area 7: Last one.  Assemble the obvious speeder parts and you have your 
 classy ride.  The Landspeeder doesn't do much apart from gliding around, but 
 it does that job well.  Use it to cross the quicksand.  You can go further 
 back if you wish for some more studs, or just go to the right to finally 
 reach Ben's house.  Of course, there are four buttons in front of the house, 
 requiring four characters to step on them.  Assemble the lever near the 
 quicksand's edge and pull it to create the bridge for the rest of the 
 characters.  Now, you can explore and bash some stormies, or just have 
 everyone step on the buttons (when you put one of them on, the rest follow 
 suit automatically), pull the lever, and head in to finish the level.

Starting Characters: Luke Skywalker (Tatooine), Ben Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2
Added Characters: Han Solo, Chewbacca
Enemies: Sandtrooper, Imperial Spy, Seeker Droid

True Jedi at 60,000: There's a lot of studs to pick up in this area, but a 
 lot to potentially miss as well.  Just be careful and Force things before 
 you blast them.

Area 1: Well, there's lots to do in this place.  Plenty of items to destroy 
 and objects to use the Force on.  Sandtroopers patrol this area, though.  
 Sometimes they leave you alone, but most of the time, they harrass you.  
 To leave this area, find the stairs made out of bricks near the back.  Use the 
 Force on those and you'll make a ramp further back.  Walk Threepio up it and 
 have him use the panel to open the main door and move on.  You can also bring 
 the Landspeeder with you if you wish.

Area 2: More things to blow up, more studs, more troopers.  In this area, 
 it's time to make yourself something good, but it takes some effort.  First, 
 use the Force on the obvious glowing part near the back rubble gate.  Next, 
 have Artoo hover up and open the door on the left.  Smash the large barrels 
 to the right of the rubble gate, then break open the box containing the blue 
 stud further to the right.  Breaking that box will allow you to assemble a 
 ramp which will lead Threepio up to the panel he can work.  Okay, time to 
 get to work.  What was in the barrels will make feet.  Use the Force to 
 move those.  Next, use the Force on the obvious leg parts, then assemble the 
 pile near the gate to make the cabin base.  Force that onto the legs.  
 Finally, assemble the head and Force that onto it.  Suddenly, some jerk will 
 decide to steal your ride.  Either blast him out of the AT-ST, or just use 
 Ben's Mind Trick and he'll hop right out.  Use C to get in so no one else can 
 steal it.  Use the AT-ST to break down the two rubble gates here.  The one 
 closer to the entrance is a small bonus area with a Double Score Zone.  Clean 
 up there as you will.  You can also run your Speeder through the car wash 
 here, then drop it off at the dealership for some studs (just don't try to 
 take it back!)  Anyway, move ahead past the furthest rubble gate.  You'll 
 come upon another AT-ST, which your partner can use.  Clean up all the 
 garbage in this area and move on through the far shutter, leaving your 
 vehicles behind.  The door won't open until you clean the area of troopers 
 and seeker droids.

Area 3: This is the cantina entryway.  Shoot down the four droid detectors 
 so the metal guys can get through.  Hop on one of the four buttons near the 
 door and your companions should follow suit, letting you get in.

Area 4: After the cutscene, you'll be in charge of Han and Chewie for a 
 while.  There's not much to do in the cantina except start a bar fight or 
 blow up the chairs for studs.  Exit by the far right.

Area 5: Ah, remember him?  That's a Kubaz named Garindan, but in this game 
 he's just referenced as "Imperial Spy".  He'll sic some troopers on you, so 
 bust them up.  If you wish, you can build the grapple point over here now and 
 leave by the top doorway.  Both lead you to the same area.

Area 6: If on the upper area, you can use the grapple point to grapple over 
 to the other side and pull a lever, which will give you a crate.  Push the 
 crate off the edge and down the trail to the end.  Shoot it to blow it up 
 so you can move on to the next area (after cleaning up studs).

Area 7: Gun down all the stormies in this area, including those on the 
 dewbacks.  Either jump and shoot at the ones high up, or climb on a dewback 
 and jump off it to reach the upper area.  Once you're all set here, hop on a 
 dewback, then vault off it to reach the higher area in the upper left where 
 Garindan ran off, then down the stairs and through the shutter.  Make sure 
 you have True Jedi by now, because you can't come back this way.

Area 8: You run back into the other four, here.  Also here is Garindan, who 
 will call in stormtroopers.  Shoot them all down and he'll call in a second 
 wave.  Shoot that wave up and Garindan's lifebar will appear.  At this point, 
 you have to drain his life or else he'll keep calling in more stormies, so 
 blast him to smithereens, then mop up the rest of the troopers and studs.  
 Hop in the Falcon to end this long mission.

True Jedi at 60,000: Some side areas really help with this.  Beyond that, 
 just gun down all that you can see.

Area 1: You'll begin in the control room near the hangar, helmetless.  Use 
 the Force on the door to turn it into a TIE Fighter and move on out.  Use the 
 helmet dispenser to get a stormtrooper helmet, which will allow you to access 
 the doors with white circles.  Stand in the circle and press Z and the door 
 will open.  Take out the troopers and officer (they may not attack just yet 
 if your character is still wearing the helmet).  Assemble the two control 
 panels and use the resulting Artoo panel.  At this point, Ben will take off to 
 deactivate the tractor beam, Artoo and Threepio will hide in the closet, and 
 it'll be up to the three remaining characters to finish this mission.  Head 
 out the now open door to the left.

Area 2: Ben will run ahead of you.  Take out the troopers.  You can't follow 
 him across the chasm, so go to the left.

Area 3: Blast them!  Note the helmet dispenser here.  Here's a trick I 
 learned.  Being hit once will make you lose your helmet.  To prevent this, 
 have a character take a helmet, then switch off to another character.  Since 
 the one you control is generally in the lead, he'll take the most hits, so 
 your helmet will be a lot safer.  This doesn't work 100% of the time, but it 
 does give you better odds.  Anyway, move ahead and you'll find Ben being 
 attacked by troopers.  Blast them all and he'll repay you by giving you a 
 bridge to cross.  Once across, you'll find TIE pilots will be upon you by 
 climbing up the catwalk.  If you shoot the hook they're using, they'll 
 stop bugging you.  Take them out and blast the crates blocking your 
 way.  Blast your way through the corridor and turn right at the end.

Area 4: In front of you is a white circle.  If you still have a helmet, 
 quickly use it to open the door before the pilots come up and tag you.  Fight 
 if you wish, or just pass through the door.

Area 5: At the center of this room, assemble the rotator switch, then use it 
 to move the bridge.  Rotate it until it stops and you can climb up these 
 ledges.  Blast the troopers and take a helmet if you need it, then pass 
 through the door.

Area 6: Hmm.  Looks like they haven't noticed you, yet.  I say go to the door 
 and assemble the panel so you can quickly use the helmet, then blast the 
 bagoogies out of the place.  Continue on to the next room.  Take out the 
 troopers here.  If you still have a helmet (or want to go back and get one), 
 you can use it to access the near elevator and ride up to a Double Score 
 Zone with a bunch of Beach Troopers.  Otherwise, take the far elevator down.  

Area 7: Blast the bad guys.  Also, take out the cameras over the elevators 
 (they take about four clean shots) to prevent more troopers from coming.  
 Assemble the levers in the middle of the room and pull them to move to the 
 actual cell block.  You can access any of the six cells for goodies, but the 
 Princess is in the third one on the right.  Have two characters in there to 
 step on the buttons to free her and finish this mission.

True Jedi at 46,000: This one is tough, particularly given the possibility of 
 dying so much.  Stay clear of crowds of stormies, and try not to rely on 
 melee attacks, as you'll only get hurt.

Area 1: Assemble the pile near the door, then hop up and use the lever and 
 you're out of the garbage disposal.  As soon as you head out, you'll be set 
 upon by stormies and the like, so move cautiously.  Don't worry about the 
 helmet dispenser.  You won't need it, yet.  Head out the far end of the 
 corridor.

Area 2: Use the lever at the back wall, but I suggest you NOT try to use the 
 grapple point just yet, unless you want to be face down amidst a gaggle of 
 stormies.  Take them all out from a safe distance, then clean up the lower 
 floor.  In particular, move the structure with a blue platform over onto the 
 red dot, which will connect it to the rotator.  Rotate it to raise the blue 
 platform a bit, then head back up to the upper level near the entrance.  
 Hit the lever to move the grapple point (and get some studs), then hit the 
 lever one more time and you'll be able to cross over as long as the blue 
 platform's raised.  You can't quite get to the door, so pull the lever to 
 drop a box.  Push that along the track and off the ledge so you can access 
 a lower compartment.  Hop in the yellow... I guess it's a floor waxer or 
 something.  Use it to cross over the five red lights on the floor in quick 
 succession, which will give you a platform near the door.  Now you need a 
 helmet, so go back to the first area and grab one (you can use the "other 
 guy gets a helmet" strategy that got you through the last mission relatively 
 painlessly).  Now, head back and use it on the door.

Area 3: Blast the squad to the left.  Head over to the right and assemble 
 the lever on the right wall.  Pull it.  Gun down the stormies and pull the 
 next levers.  In the next small room, push the box into the wall to activate 
 the next lever and move on down the corridor to the end.

Area 4: Activate the three levers at the end, here to start a platform 
 rotating.  Hop on when you can.  Once across, mind the dropping stormies.  
 Grapple up to the next level and pull the lever to drop some pieces.  Drop 
 down and assemble them to get the elevator moving.  Grapple back up and hop 
 on.  Get off to the left to find more stormies and a helmet dispenser, which 
 you'll need to get back on the elevator and to the top.  Activate the door 
 and head out.

Area 5: Just pass through this corridor.

Area 6: No, you didn't take a wrong turn.  Assemble the pieces as quickly as 
 you can because there's no end to the bad guys that are going to be pouring 
 through the door.  You can buy some time by closing both levers to close the 
 door, but you need to get the grapple point built.  Swing across, then build 
 the next one, quick.  Get a helmet from the dispenser inside, then swing 
 across and use it.  Head through the door.

Area 7: Keep moving forward and shoot the door at the end.  Yikes!  Gun down 
 all these guys as quick as possible, then shut both doors to keep more from 
 coming in.  I suggest shooting the stuff in the back right, as there is a 
 Powerup hidden among them.  Quickly build the door on the far wall.  Unless 
 you utilize the Powerup, it will probably take a few tries and reshutting of 
 doors, but keep at it.  Once the door's together, bust it down and move on.

Area 8: Almost home.  You can now see Ben and Vader fighting up a level.  Run 
 around the front of the area.  Push the structure on the back right wall over 
 to the right and you'll get pieces for a grapple point.  Grapple up and hit 
 the lever.  This will raise the Falcon a little bit and drop a ton of 
 stormies, so fight your best.  At the near right wall is a small pile.  Put 
 it together and push the door to the left to release Artoo and Threepio.  
 You'll need to use Artoo to unlock the two switches down here (near left and 
 far right) and each time you do, you'll release a flock of stormies.  When you 
 hit the near left one, you'll have to manuever another floor waxer over five 
 switches.  For the last one, flip the lever near the entrance to release a 
 steam jet.  Put Threepio on it and he'll be jetted up to where he can access 
 the last switch.  You can now hop on the Falcon and get out of here.

Enemies: TIE Fighter, TIE Fighter (Darth Vader), Turbolasers

True Jedi at 30,000: There's not much to say except "shoot everything".

Area 1: Shoot any stuff you can for studs, naturally.  Grab a torpedo from 
 the purple light and shoot it with Z while the target in front of the shield 
 gate is bracketed.  Past the gate, you'll find TIEs will be upon you.  In 
 addition to turbolaster batteries and more TIEs, you'll also find the next 
 shield gate ahead.  Head to camera right to find four targets that you need to 
 blow up with torpedoes to remove the shield.  Blow up all four targets and 
 blast down the blue barrier to move on.

Area 2: Cause general mayhem in this next area (I know you love it).  There 
 are two "quad targets" to torp this time, one halfway up on the right, and one 
 near the shield gate at the back.  Dust them like the Top Ace you are and 
 press on.

Area 3: More of the same here, really.  Two more quad targets.  Plenty more 
 turbolasers and TIEs, though.  Once you bust down the shield, continue on 
 to the trench.

Area 4: I never get tired of the trench run.  Simply press on ahead and 
 take out as many laser batteries as you can, avoiding fire from the TIEs 
 behind you.  Once you reach the end, a rather famous cutscene will occur and 
 you'll be at the exhaust port.  Simply blast to pieces all the guns guarding 
 the exhaust port.  You'll know you're done when the shield is gone and you've 
 got a target lock.  Let fly your torpedo.  Oh, and if you miss, you'll have 
 to go all the way back to the beginning of the trench.  Boom.

True Jedi at 26,000: This is a tough mission to get that much.  You'll more 
 than likely have to drag some of the bombs into the white walls to knock 
 loose some extra studs, because you'll need the boost.  This is very 
 tough to complete with doing it in Free Play or with multipliers.  I suggest 
 you have a good 20,000 under your belt before going to the last area.

Area 1: Use ground emplacements for studs.  Enemy vehicles won't cut it.  
 Don't worry about going left, there's a Imperial gate, there.  Just cut 
 straight ahead through the area.  Your objective is to go to the right and 
 back as far as you can.  In the very back, the terrain will dip towards a 
 wall of rocks.  Near your launching point, you may notice red lights and a 
 small round object.  That's a towable bomb.  You can use that bomb to take 
 out the white walls in the area, but your main objective is to tow it all 
 the way to the end and let it roll into the rocks to blow them up.  If you 
 roll it into an AT-ST or something, it will detonate.  Also, Probe Droids 
 will try to grab the bomb away from you, so shoot them down.  Once the gate 
 is down, proceed.

Area 2: There are two AT-ATs in this area.  I shouldn't tell you what you 
 have to do to them, but press Z near them and wrap around them with your 
 tow cable.  Just that's not enough, though.  You need to grab a bomb near 
 the base and drag it into the fallen AT-AT to blow it up.  Do this to the 
 one near the back rock wall to remove the rocks.  Then you can roll a bomb 
 into the wall itself to clear the way forward.  The next wall is much 
 further ahead, has white walls placed to block your way, and you have to 
 roll the bomb down a narrow causeway to get to the end.  It may actually 
 help to take it slowly here.  The Probe Droids won't harrass you too much 
 in this area, thankfully.  Once the back wall is destroyed, press on.

Area 3: This final area is a big circle, with the camera at the center.  
 What you need to do here is take out the enemies specified.  First, you need 
 to down eleven Probe Droids, then eleven AT-STs, then two AT-ATs, then a 
 group of four Probes, six AT-STs, and one AT-AT.  Once they're all kaput, 
 this mission is complete.

True Jedi at 40,000: Shouldn't be too hard.  Just explore, shoot, and make 
 sure you don't die.

Area 1: As you make your way to the door, rubble will fall in your way.  
 Assemble the rubble into a bomb, which will blow the door.  Continue down 
 the tunnel, blasting snowtroopers.  At the end, assemble the generator, then 
 shoot it three times to melt the ice.  Continue on.

Area 2: Take out the troopers in this next room.  To move ahead, push the 
 generator onto the red bar to melt the ice.  In the next tunnel, take out 
 the snowtrooper, including the one manning the E-Web blaster.  You can 
 reassemble the E-Web after you blow it to blast the gates on the back wall.  
 Just watch out for the troopers that show up.  Hop off to get them to stop 
 coming.  You can't access the Threepio panel, yet, so blow the containers 
 off to the right and move on.

Area 3: Assemble the cart to get it rolling around.  You can use the cart as 
 a step to get to the ledges with studs and the minikit.  After which, push 
 the rotator switch to get it rolling down the far track.  Return the way you 
 came.

Area 2: Cross now to the door on the left that was just cleared.  Inside is 
 Threepio.  Have him access the panel on the far door (use the E-Web to clear 
 it if you haven't done so already).

Area 4: First, take out all the troopers.  Next, bust open the containers in 
 the center of the room and assemble the little car it makes.  After that, 
 move at least two of the blocks into the obvious spots on the sides of at 
 least of the fans to get them going.  Lastly, reassemble and use the E-Web to 
 clear the door.  Okay, the objective is to get in the car.  Threepio should 
 move himself over to one of the fans.  Let him drop down on the back of 
 the car, then drive him over to the door and press B or Z to launch him 
 towards it, then use him to hit the panel.  Head through the tunnel.  Watch 
 out for the panels that fall.  Assemble the bomb so it blows open the far 
 door.

Area 5: This area is a super fun ice slide.  Head left and climb up the rock 
 slope, then head over to the slide and slide down.  Your objective is to 
 hit all five buttons.  You don't have to get them in one go, so don't be 
 worried about mid-slide manuevering.  Once all five are pressed, the door 
 opens.

Area 6: Blow the containers to uncover the buttons, then push one of the 
 boxes onto a button, and have the rest of your crew stand on the other 
 three.  Head through the door, then out the door at the far end.

Area 7: We're in the hangar, finally.  Take out all troopers and guns, here.  
 Chewie will be in this area, as well.  Pull the levers on the right wall to 
 access some boxes.  Push them into the slots to release some tauntauns.  Now, 
 you need to use the E-Webs.  At the left and right ends of the force field 
 are little modules that take three hits each, so blast them with the E-Web 
 while avoiding enemy fire, then assemble the gate to the Falcon.  Use a leap 
 from a tauntaun's back to jump up on top of the Falcon and assemble the gun 
 on top and the ramp will lower.  Climb aboard to finish.

True Jedi at 30,000: This is quite easy when you realize that the blue 
 asteroids regenerate, with studs.  It'll take a minute or two, but you can 
 have 30,000 in almost no time.

Area 1: Don't worry too much about studs here.  Just concentrate on taking 
 out the sixteen guns, four on each Star Destroyer.

Area 2: You're in the asteroid field, now.  The blue-marked ones can be 
 destroyed for studs and torpedoes, so take them out hard.  At the end, 
 use four torpedoes (you'll have to go back for more) on the rock wall in 
 the big asteroid, then push on through.

Area 3: Plenty more asteroids and TIEs.  Blast down the rubble at the end 
 with four torpedos.  After a quick run along a big asteroid, you'll come upon 
 a hole which is, of course, the space slug.  You can get torpedoes in here 
 if you wish, or just go back out and blast the far wall to get back out.

Area 4: Hey, more asteroids.  At the end is a sizable asteroid with several 
 targets that you need to blow up with torps.  Once it's kaput, head out and 
 you're done!

Enemies: Bat, Swamp Snake, Vader Apparition

True Jedi at 52,000: Shouldn't be hard.  Remember all plants are blastable, 
 except those which you need the Force for.

Area 1: Assemble the ramps and head up the hill.  Watch out the bats.  They're 
 small, but they'll crawl ya.  Proceed through the swamp.  In the first 
 pond area, watch out for the swamp snake.  Luke can grapple across, but 
 Artoo will have to just go through the swamp, using his scope to see 
 above.  Once you reach the end of the path, have Artoo hover across and use 
 the panel to raise a bridge so Luke can cross.  Blast the plants away and 
 move on.

Area 2: In this next area, assemble the button, then step on it.  Have Artoo 
 hover to and step on the remaining buttons, as each one raises a new part 
 of the bridge.  Once across, head up to Yoda's hut.  He'll lead you into a 
 training area.

Area 3: Okay.  You've switched characters now.  Dagobah Luke can double jump 
 and swing his saber, but he cannot use the Force alone.  Find Yoda and press 
 C near him and he'll hop on you.  You'll be able to use the Force, then.  
 Destroy everything in the area with your saber, then use the Force on the 
 remaining stuff to create a bridge to another part of land.  From the second 
 section, hop on the buttons to get across the swamp, as you did earlier in 
 the mission.  On the last section of land, you have to lower two mushrooms to 
 get Artoo to a panel.  It sounds easy, except that Artoo gives you no help 
 in this regard.  What you need to do is lower one mushroom, wait a moment, 
 then lower the second mushroom.  Quickly switch to Artoo and get on the first 
 until it rises, then hover over to the second, wait until it rises, then 
 hover over to the panel, use it, and leave by the gate.

Area 2: Believe it or not, you're back in Area 2, only further ahead.  You've 
 also got Yoda as playable and Luke has his own Force powers, now.  If you 
 go toward the camera, you can go back to exploring the area around Yoda's 
 hut if you want, but let's move ahead.  Use the Force some ways forward to 
 find a tractor.  Use the Force again to take the back end of the tractor and 
 make a ramp.  Have Artoo go up the ramp, then hover around the tree to find 
 a panel he can use, which will raise a platform for Luke and Yoda.  Saber 
 down the barrier to enter the cave.

Area 4: Proceed along the ledges, stepping on buttons to allow Artoo to 
 follow.  Keep moving straight along the tunnel until the end, where you'll 
 find the Vader Apparition.  Knock off two hearts and it will hide on a 
 ledge.  There are two boxes in front of that ledge.  Jump on one and Yoda 
 will jump on the other, and the two of you can lift each other up.  Knock 
 two more hearts off Vader and he'll move to a higher ledge.  Assemble the 
 step and Force them all into position.  Take two more hearts and the 
 apparition will go back to the ground floor, so finish him off, then leave 
 by the far gate.

Area 5: Use the Force on all the plants here, to uncover a pile.  Assemble 
 it into a rotator switch and push it to raise a bridge.  Then, head across 
 to the next area and clean up the plants.  In the back are two boxes that 
 need to be dual-raised by Luke and Yoda just as before.  Push off the box 
 that's on top, here, and turn it into an Artoo panel, which will blow up the 
 gate when activated, and you'll find your X-Wing (how it got over here, 
 we'll never know).  Luke can't raise it, so switch to Yoda and have him do 
 it to complete the level.

Enemies: Stormtrooper, Darth Vader

True Jedi at 14,000: Small total, but a short level.  Watch for blues, and 
 try not to fall off too much.

Area 1: Force one of your wings into a platform, then have Artoo hover to the 
 back side of the room with the Artoo panel and activate it, which will let 
 Luke cross to the door, where he can assemble another Artoo panel, which 
 opens the door.

Area 2: Periodically, stormies will drop down to fight you.  Use the Artoo 
 panel and bust down the nearby wall.  Push the structure into the center of 
 the room, then use the pile from the wall to make an E-Web.  Force it onto 
 the stand and blast down the blue bars on the door, then pass through.  Go 
 to the end of the corridor and use the Artoo panel.

Area 3: Look at that.  Already Vader shows up.  Head down and duel him.  
 Once you take a few hearts away, he'll start playing coy, bouncing around 
 the room away from you.  At that point, have Artoo use the panel to jet 
 some steam and stun him.  Once you drain all his hearts, he'll run off, 
 leaving a pile.  Assemble it into a crane, then grab Artoo and drop him off 
 near the door.  Artoo will automatically activate a panel to let you over.  
 Go grab a helmet from the dispenser, then use it on the white circle to 
 move on.

Area 4: Use the Force on the wall to create a fan, then have Artoo use the 
 panel to get the lift moving.  Jump Luke onto the fan to get blown up to the 
 ledge, then ride the lift to the other side.  Hop on the lift below to lower 
 it so Artoo can cross, then use the Force on another fan to ride it up.  
 Activate the panel on the lift, then ride up to the doorway.

Area 5: Time to fight again.  Knock down a few hearts and he'll jump away.  
 Take out the stormies, then use the Force on the two things on the back 
 wall to make a ramp.  Have Artoo go up the ramp and use the panel to steam 
 jet Vader.  Hit him some more.  Next, assemble the rotator switch and the 
 elevator panel.  Artoo will stand on the elevator, so rotate the switch and 
 he'll hit the panel on top to steam Vader again.  Continue on doing this 
 until Vader is drained again and he'll run off.  Chase him.

Area 6: Now, Vader is across the way, and stormies are popping out of holes.  
 Have Artoo float across and use both panels to close them, then switch back 
 to Luke.  When Vader Forces something at you, Force it as it gets close to 
 push it back.  Then, he'll come back for more dueling.  Continue this until 
 you Force an object into him that breaks the window.  Force the glass to 
 create a platform, then follow him out.

Area 7: Chase Vader down this area.  Use the Force to create a ramp, then 
 continue.  Have Artoo activate a lift.  It's all pretty simple.  Chase Vader 
 to the end and drain his hearts to finish the level.

 break, including ones stacked on top of them, so gun them all down.

Area 1: Go straight ahead, chasing Fett and gunning down stormies.  Fett 
 will pull a lever to turn stairs into a ramp.  Blast the nearby wall to find 
 another level which will reverse it.  Continue up the passage, following 
 Fett.  You'll fight him for a little bit, here.  Shoot him as he jets 
 around to drain his hearts, then follow him back out of the room.  He'll 
 operate a green circle, so follow him through that.  Keep tailing him until 
 the end of the corridor.  Fett will take off in his ship, Slave I, leaving 
 you behind, but at least you'll find Artoo.  Head back the way you came, 
 because there are plenty of doors for Artoo to use.  You'll notice there 
 are now steam vents open.  Go into the steam as Artoo and use the Artoo panel 
 to shut them down so everyone else can pass.  Continue back along the 
 corridor until you find another Artoo door.  Open it to find the garbage 
 room.  Take out the Ugnaughts and clear away the garbage.  Push the plug 
 back into its socket and pull the lever to get all of Threepio's pieces.  
 Put him back together and now you've got him, and you can access the Threepio 
 panel nearby.  You'll need the helmet dispenser in the next room eventually, 
 but for now, just run ahead and clear the place out.  You'll come upon two 
 elevators.  The right-hand elevator has a white circle, and the left-hand 
 one has a green circle.  Naturally, you need to use the helmet dispenser 
 earlier and use the white circle to move ahead, just watch out for incoming 
 fire.

Area 2: Take out all the troopers here, then assemble the grapple point 
 that rains down.  Grapple across, then hop in the crane and use the magnet 
 to get the droids over to your side.  Grapple up another level and assemble 
 the lever.  Pull it to get the elevator moving to get the droids up to 
 your level.  Now, either double jump or float past the red beams which 
 keep the conveyor moving, then hold down the switch so everyone can get 
 cross without being pushed back.  Manuever Artoo around the little 
 obstruction and float him across to the panel to allow the non-droids to get 
 across, but you still need to get Threepio to your area, and he can't jump 
 over the gray object in his way.  Grapple up to the top and blast the thing 
 hanging to drop it on the obstruction so Threepio can get by.  Have him 
 access the door panel to open it, then press on through this corridor.  At 
 the end, have Artoo get rid of the steam jets and proceed to the back of 
 the room.

Area 3: There's the Falcon.  Step on both sets of buttons to fix the levers, 
 then pull both to extend the bridge to the ship.  Head back out.

Area 2: Follow the wall past the vents to another Artoo door.  Head on out.

Area 3: Now, you just have to take out a jillion troopers guarding the 
 Falcon.  Once the door opens, you're ready to go!

Starting Characters: Princess Leia (Boushh), Chewbacca
Added Characters: Luke Skywalker (Jedi), C-3PO, R2-D2, Han Solo (Skiff)
Enemies: TT-8L, Gamorrean, Rancor

True Jedi at 43,000: Not much to this one.  Just be sure to hit all the 
 torches.

Area 1: You're starting outside Jabba's Palace.  Going up to the gate will 
 release two TT-8L's who will open fire on you, so blast them repeatedly.  
 Assemble the platform in front of the gate and hop up to expose the third 
 one.  Once all three are blown, the gate will open.  As you enter, you'll be 
 set upon by Gamorreans.  They keep popping out of the holes in the ceiling 
 until you pull the levers to shut them.  Once both are closed, you can 
 explore more freely.  The door at the far end will only open for bounty 
 hunters.  Happily, you can provide such credentials, soon.  Head to the left 
 and you'll find a helmet dispenser.  Not only will this give Leia the Boushh 
 helmet and allow her to use green circles, it will also allow her to throw 
 thermal detonators by pressing Z.  That'll be quite useful.  When something 
 can be blown by a thermal detonator, you'll know because it'll be a shiny 
 gray and your shots will rebound off it.  Anyway, use the green circle and 
 move on up the stairs.  At the top, the door will open, and hey!  It's Luke!  
 Close the two hatches to stop the Gamorrean flow, then assemble the Bounty 
 Hunter Panel.  Have anyone wearing a Boushh helmet use it, then move on 
 through the door.

Area 2: In this room, there's another Gamorrean hatch on the left that you 
 should close quickly.  Blow up the contraption on the right, then assemble 
 it into a platform.  Take control of Leia.  Chewie will hop on automatically, 
 so hop on yourself and Luke will raise you up.  Go left, then drop into the 
 nearby cell and pull both levers to open the door at the far end of the 
 room.  With a Boussh hat on from the helmet dispenser, face the shiny bricks 
 blocking the way forward and press Z to toss a detonator on them.  Quickly go 
 to the far end of the next room and pull the lever to close another 
 Gamorrean hatch.  Blast the four supports on either side of the door on the 
 right to open it and move on.  Watch out for loose grates in the floor, then 
 move on to the droid workshop.  Take out the Gamorreans.  Now, to free your 
 droid pals.  Use the Force on the left wall and assemble the resulting pieces 
 to make a box.  Now, go to the machine on the right and pull both levers.  
 Assemble both sets of pieces to make four buttons.  These buttons will move 
 the box.  What you need to do is place the box near the cages where Artoo 
 and Threepio are kept, then use Luke to jump on the box, then double jump 
 into the cage which will lower with your combined weight.  Do so for both 
 droids, then have them open their respective panels.  Continue up the stairs 
 and open the door at the top to move on.

Area 3: This large room has two Gamorrean hatches, but you can't close one 
 of them until you can get into position.  See the three pushable objects 
 in the center?  You need to line them up on the right in their holes in 
 ascending order, then use the Force on each to make a proper ramp.  Once 
 at the top, destroy the containers and assemble a platform which you can 
 use to Force into part of a bridge.  Use the Force on the opposite side's 
 structure to finish the bridge, then cross and close the hatch.  Now, have 
 Artoo hover to the left and activate his panel to extend a bridge, then 
 have Threepio use his panel next to the door and leave.  As an addendum, if 
 you wish to get the hatches closed as quickly as possible, you need only 
 move one or two of the ramp pieces into position, as Luke can double jump 
 his way to the upper hatch if need be.

Area 4: Head down the stairs and close two hatches as quickly as possible.  
 Beat down all the Gamorreans and the gate ahead of you will open.

Area 5: Clean up the Gamorreans and close the two hatches in this room.  
 Once they're all down, you need to use the green circle next to Han's 
 carbonite block, so go back to the previous room to get a helmet.  Once 
 you've used the green circle, you can't go back, so I suggest making sure 
 you have True Jedi, or are at least pretty close, before moving on.

Area 6: Okay.  You've lost Leia, but gained Han, and there's a big ugly 
 rancor in this room ready to chomp on you.  He only has three hearts, but 
 you can't hurt him using conventional means.  The trick is to bring either 
 Threepio over to the hatch on the left or Artoo to the hatch on the right and 
 use the panel to open it, which will drop a Gamorrean.  The rancor will go 
 right for the tasty bacon, then will walk into a corner to start chowing 
 down.  Blow up the container nearest him and he'll lose a heart.  For the 
 last heart, he'll go to eat the Gamorrean under the gate.  Pull both levers 
 on each side of the gate and crunch!

True Jedi at 50,000: Try to fall as little as possible.  Lots of pieces on 
 the skiffs and the barge are bustable, so make sure you get everything, 
 because studs can be tight on this mission if you're sloppy (but not nearly 
 as tight as they were in LSW2).

Area 1: After that impressive tumbling act, take out the guards here, then 
 assemble the levers.  You can also break the nearby containers and turn 
 them into guns if you wish to fend off the enemies on the barge.  Pull the 
 two levers, which will extend a bridge to another skiff.  On the second 
 skiff, you'll get the use of Han and Chewie.  Use the Force at the right end 
 to create two levers, which, when pulled, will extend another bridge to the 
 third skiff, where Boba Fett is.  Fight him the same way you fought him in 
 Bespin: one shot to ground him, another to damage him.  Once he's Sarlacc 
 food, a fourth skiff will float over to you.  Hop onto it and take out its 
 inhabitants.  At the back, use the Force to make a floating raft.  Jump onto 
 it then over to the barge, itself.  Take out all the guards on this part of 
 the skiff.  You now need to pull three levers to proceed.  There are two 
 levers here on ground level.  One is obvious, the other is behind one of the 
 bigger flaps, which you need to Force upwards.  There's a third lever higher 
 up.  What you need to do is use the Force on a flap near the left lever and 
 jump up with Luke.  Push the box over the edge and assemble the resulting 
 grapple point.  Grapple up and proceed down the little passage to the third 
 lever, which will extend the last of the platforms leading around the side.  
 At the back of the barge is the entrance.  This part is tough because of 
 the enemies harassing you, but it can be done alone.  Use the Force on both 
 sides of the door.  The left one shows the code you need, and the right one 
 is where you have to match it.  Use the Force on the right module to rotate 
 the middle light (it needs to be yellow) and use the rotator switch to rotate 
 the lower light (it needs to be blue).  Once the code's broken, the door will 
 open up.

Area 2: Blow all the containers here to make pieces to assemble into two 
 E-Webs.  Use them to blast the gate and any guys behind that charge.  Here is 
 where you'll get the droids back.  Once this area is clean of bad guys, use 
 the Force to assemble a generator in two parts, one on the right side, and 
 other on the left after you smash it.  Assemble the Threepio panel and have 
 him use it.  Hop on the elevator.

Area 3: Blow up all that you can here, and assemble all that you can.  You 
 need to Force a wall-hanging into a box-like structure.  Then, blow the 
 two middle yellow hooks on the right wall so you can make a ball with the 
 two halves using the Force.  Use the nearby grapple point, then push the box 
 up here off the ledge.  While up here, assemble the mounting that goes on 
 the ceiling.  Now, drop down, assemble two speakers in the back corners, 
 and Force the ball into the ceiling.  Doing all this will open up the floor.  
 Step on a lit panel and your computer-controlled friend will step on the 
 other.  Do so over all the panels and the back door will open, as well as 
 having some Gamorreans rocking out.  Leave this spectacle and move on ahead 
 to the next room, then up the stairs.

Area 4: All right.  You've got Leia back, and your largest party yet.  Make 
 your way across the deck, taking out all the enemies.  As you progress you 
 can uncover a box behind the nearest mast, which you can push along its 
 intended path.  There's another box on the right side of the big modules on 
 the deck of the ship.  Push these to either side of the lower of the two and 
 you should blow the covering off it.  Next, have Threepio access the upper 
 module to blow its covering.  At the right end, you'll find a pile that you 
 can assemble into part of a stairway.  Also near here is a structure you can 
 blow to unearth a hole.  Go down that hole and follow the tunnel to get 
 inside the enclosure on the right.  Pull the lever to let both yourself and 
 the pushable box out.  Push that behind the stairs and use the Force to 
 create a ramp.  You can now go up to the next level.  Use the Force to create 
 a small ramp, then blow the ladder-like structures on the back wall and 
 Force those into the rest of the ramp.  Climb up to the top.

Area 5: This is the "big gun".  You'll need Artoo to power it up, and you'll 
 get eight shots to destroy those big modules.  You have to hit the bullseye 
 on each side to blow it up.  Once they're both destroyed, this mission is 
 complete.  Oh, and I'm told you should be careful using Thermal Detonators 
 in the area, as you can blow up the big gun, with no way to finish.

5GG. Speeder Showdown =

"Over there!  Two more of them!" - Leia
"I see them-- wait, Leia!" - Luke

Starting Characters: Princess Leia (Endor), Luke Skywalker (Endor)
Enemies: Scout Trooper, Stormtrooper, Speeder Bike, AT-ST, AT-AT

True Jedi at 55,000: Just focus more on studs while on the bikes than your 
 target bikes.  Shouldn't be a problem.

Area 1: Gun down the vegetation to uncover a platform that Luke can assemble.  
 Switch to Leia and stand on it and Luke will lift her over the tree trunk.  
 On the other side, shoot some more plants and assemble a grapple point.  
 From the high point on the right, step on the suspended platform to allow 
 Luke to join you.  Have Luke Force the next object into a ramp, then cross 
 over.

Area 2: As you progress into this area, two Speeder Bikes will be dropped off 
 here by stormies.  This next part will be slightly tedious if you're going 
 for studs.  You can move in either direction (the area's one big circle), 
 but you can see further ahead going north, so go north.  Your objective is 
 to take out the two troopers on speeder bikes.  If you're collecting stuff, 
 I suggest making at least a full loop and getting True Jedi, and the six 
 minikits, before taking out the bikers.  Use the A button to loop if they 
 get behind you.  Once the bikes are down, you'll pull over into a shielded 
 area.  Your objective while here is to blow down that big spinny module in 
 the back.  You'll need the AT-ST roaming around for that, so either shoot the 
 driver out of it or use the Mind Trick with Luke to take control and blast 
 the module.  Once it's boom, get back on the bikes and you'll have to deal 
 with three bikers.  Take them down, and you'll pull over again.  In this 
 area, head to the left and Force the block into a step.  Double jump up and 
 Force the second block to make stairs for Leia.  Assemble the grapple point, 
 and grapple up to the lever to drop pieces for another AT-ST.  Force it 
 together, then use it to destroy the big module, then get back on your 
 bikes.  Now, you have to take out four bikes, then, once again, use the AT-ST 
 to destroy another module.  Then, five bikes.  At the last stop (which, 
 incidentally, is the first area), head towards the camera, across the bridge, 
 and bust up all the plants to find feet and the pieces to a rotator switch.  
 Free the AT-ST and put it together, then use it to destroy the two cages 
 hanging just north.  Force those into a bridge, then cross with the AT-ST and 
 blow up the last module to lower the shield gate.  Finally, leave this area 
 by going right.

Area 3: There's lots to blow up, here, but all you need to do is activate 
 both levers and take the elevator up.

Area 4: Cross to the left.

Area 5: Whoa!  This is scary!  Okay, your objective in partial is actually 
 to commandeer that big ol' AT-AT back there.  If you wish to cut back on 
 stormtrooper interruptions, take out the hooks on front wall.  First, pull 
 the four levers that are stationed around the platform.  These will 
 deactivate the shields on each of the modules in the distance.  Once they're 
 all gone, go over to that green-lit platform near the AT-AT to be launched 
 into it.  Whee!  Go postal on all four of the modules to activate two more 
 levers.  Hop out and pull the levers and you're done this mission.

Starting Characters: Han Solo (Endor), Princess Leia (Endor), Chewbacca, 
 C-3PO, R2-D2, Wicket
Enemies: Scout Trooper, Stormtrooper, Imperial Officer, AT-ST

True Jedi at 90,000: Shouldn't be too bad.  Blast all the vegetation you can 
 outside, and bust up whatever wall ornaments you can inside.

Area 1: Head off to the right after wreaking havoc in the area.  Take Wicket, 
 then press Z near the hatch to crawl through it.  Have Wicket assemble the 
 two sides of the bridge to let everyone across.  Continue to the right, 
 bust down the gate at the next hut you see, and hit the Threepio panel, which 
 will release a grapple point.  Put it together, grapple up, and pull the 
 lever to raise the bridge.  Go all the way right and down the ramp.

Area 2: Continue down the path.  Watch out for Scout Troopers.  Blow away 
 their grapple hooks to prevent them from coming up.  Clear all the debris 
 off the "pushing area", then assemble the box and push it into the yellow 
 clamps.  You may have to kind of adjust to get it in just right.  Once it's 
 in, have Wicket crawl up and pull the lever, then push the box into the 
 slot.  Have the entire crew step on the six buttons that just came up to 
 head down.

Area 3: Take out all the troopers, then start blowing up plants.  Near the 
 tree with the troopers up in it, you'll find parts for a rotator switch.  
 Rotate it so Wicket can reach the shaft.  Have him stand on the button to 
 keep a grapple point visible, so one of your cohorts can grapple up and 
 pull the lever to let everyone else up.  Head along ground level until 
 you reach the two large gates.  Blow open the module in front of the gates 
 to make a Threepio panel.  Activating it uncovers six buttons, three on each 
 side.  Have everyone step on them to open the first gates.  There are two 
 more gates after these, one on each side.  Go to the right and assemble the 
 ramp so the droids can get up, then go left, have Wicket crawl up, pull the 
 lever, and assemble the grapple point so everyone else can go to the left 
 gate.  Pass through and on to the next area.  

Area 4: Move ahead, taking out all the bad guys.  Use C to man the catapult 
 and hurl about five rocks into the wall to break it down.  Take out the 
 bad guys and the AT-ST.  Commandeer the AT-ST and use it to break down 
 the far wall.  You've now made it to the shield generator bunker.  Remove 
 all the bad guys and empty the AT-STs.  Your objective, naturally, is to get 
 into the bunker.  Take an AT-ST and blast the structure surrounding the  
 tree at the north end.  Hop off the AT-ST near the platform it uncovers and 
 step on the button to make a grapple point visible, which your buddy will 
 use to pull a lever, releasing another grapple point, which will allow you 
 to get on top of the bunker.  Break the stuff up here to uncover pieces you 
 need to assemble a pushing surface.  Push the canister off the bunker and 
 assemble an Artoo Panel in front of the bunker.  Lastly, assemble a small 
 ramp so Artoo can get up to the panel.  Activate it and go on in.

Area 5: Head down the stairs and blast the lock on the door.  Clean out the 
 room.  You need to go further in, here, but you need to remove the blast 
 shield first.  First, pull the blue lever to remove the blue node.  Blast 
 down the door to the left.  Clean out the room and much of the debris.  You 
 need to find three floor buttons to make platforms on the left.  Hop up them 
 and clear out a pushing area, where you can push a box into the wall, making 
 the platforms a ramp, so Threepio can access a panel, which will reveal a 
 lever that removes the purple node of the blast shield.  Head back and blast 
 the door to the right.  Use the Artoo panel to get the elevator going, then 
 go up, hop the gap to the right, and build a small bridge so Threepio can 
 reach the panel and you can shut off the green node.  Now, go up the 
 elevator with Artoo, then float him across in front of the window to reach 
 the Artoo Panel, which will create a hatch for Wicket.  Go through and you 
 can shut off the yellow node.  Pull the levers in the main room, now, to 
 remove the blast shield.  Head in and assemble the four charges to complete 
 the mission.

"So be it... Jedi...  If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed!" 
 - Emperor Palpatine

Starting Characters: Luke Skywalker (Jedi), Darth Vader
Enemies: The Emperor, Imperial Guard

True Jedi at 40,000: Well, first of all, ignore the Emperor for a bit and 
 run around and clean up, first.  You won't get the total, but you'll get 
 close, so you can focus on fighting him, and when you get access to new 
 areas, take the opportunity to explore.  Don't forget that Vader has Sith 
 Force powers that can access what a Jedi's powers can't.  You should just 
 make it.  In the part with the lightning floor, definitely wait until you 
 chase the Emperor off to Sith Force all the red lights.  You'll get a good 
 amount of studs from that area.

Area 1: Wow, that's a lot of hearts.  Duel him.  When he puts on the lightning 
 hurt, switch characters and smack him.  Get him down by about five hearts and 
 he'll run off, leaving a small mess behind.  Also, two Imperial Guards will 
 attack every time he runs off.  They have four hearts and good dueling 
 skills, so be careful.  If you can, just use Vader's Force Choke to do them 
 in.  Go over to the spot the Emperor took off from to find piles and a fan.  
 Put them together, then have both characters use the Force to make the fan.  
 Float up to the rafters.  He'll electrify the floor in front of him.  Watch 
 for the path that darkens and follow it, stopping on the safe spots.  Once 
 you reach him, you'll duel him a bit more.  Once you get him down to seven, 
 he'll run off again.  Chase him and knock down two more hearts.  He'll fly 
 up above.  Assemble the elevator and have both characters use the Force to 
 ride up.  Knock off another heart, then chase him to the other side.  Knock 
 off another and he'll drop back down to the floor.  Another two will put 
 him near the edge.  Strike him once more for the last one.  That's it!

"The shield is down!  Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor!" 
 - Admiral Ackbar

Vehicles: Millenium Falcon
Enemies: TIE Fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, Imperial Star Destroyer

True Jedi at 35,000: This is a huge pain in the butt.  Not only is there a 
 rather small amount of studs to be had, but you will die.  A LOT.  Costing 
 you 2,000 studs every time.  The only way I managed this was to take a X2 
 multiplier in with me and blast everything on the way out.  Even having 
 next to nothing going in, I made the amount.

Area 1: It's you against four Star Destroyers.  You need to pick up torps 
 from shooting down TIE Bombers, then shoot each of their shield generators 
 to destroy them.  Destroy all four Star Destroyers to move on.

Area 2: You're inside, now.  Press on ahead, blowing up everything you can.  
 Once you see the torps, you'll need them for up ahead, with four targets 
 flanking a shield gate.  Destroy all of them and move on.

Area 3: You're heading deeper, now.  Take a bunch of torps and press on 
 ahead.  Once you reach the end, you'll find the two targets will fire 
 missiles at you, so blast them quickly.  If you get a missile on you, 
 just keep flying around and it'll eventually self-detonate.  Head into 
 the core.

Area 4: Okay, your task here is to blow up each of the nodes guarding 
 the core along the walls.  If you get too close, you'll bounce off, so 
 keep a distance and wait (slowly) for the nodes to open so you can blow 
 them up.  Once they're all gone, wait in front of the core for it to 
 expose its blue casing, then blast it.  Once that's done, just torp it 
 and boom.  Time to go.  You'll progress back through each of the areas 
 you just went through.  Just keep shooting to clear debris and you should 
 be okay.  Yeeha.

6. FREE PLAY RUNTHROUGHS
******************************************************************************

In Free Play, you'll enter the mission with only two characters.  Adjustments 
will be made so you CAN complete the mission with two characters.  At the 
outset, you'll be allowed to pick whichever character out of all available 
you wish.  Once that's done, the computer will add on other characters that 
you will need to access all the stuff in the mission (if you have them 
available).  This allows you to go and get all the stuff without having to 
worry about building the proper team.

The type of characters added tends to go like this, assuming you have them: 
you'll definitely get an astromech, a protocol droid, a Sith, a bounty hunter, 
a high jumper, an Imperial, and a shortie.  You may also get a Jedi or a 
normal gunner, too.  Also, depending on the mission, you may also get a bunch 
of the mission's enemy characters.

In vehicle missions, you'll simply get access to every vehicle.  There are 
few enough so it won't be too overwhelming.

There will be no story clips, and some missions will be slightly changed to 
reflect this.  All you need to do is reach the end and get all the stuff, so 
go for it!

Note that some collectibles have specific requirements.  Here's what I mean 
when I say each:

"Grappler": You basically need any of the non-droid gunners with the ability 
 to grapple.  You'll get some in I-3, II-3, III-3, IV-1, V-2, or VI-1, 
 depending on the paths you decide to take.

"High Jumper": You need a character that double jump rather high.  You can 
 use Jar Jar Binks for this (I-2), Captain Tarpals, a Grievous' Bodyguard 
 (which technically have a high "single" jump, but let's not mince), or 
 General Grievous.  I should point out that High Jumpers only work in 
 Episodes I-III.  In IV-VI, their second jump is nerfed, because that game 
 didn't use high jumpers.

"Astromech": You need R2-D2 or any of the other astromech droids.  You can 
 get R2 at I-5, III-2, IV-1, V-4, or VI-1, and you can get R4 at II-2.

"Shortie": You need Anakin Skywalker (Boy), Boba Fett (Boy), a Jawa, Wicket, 
 an Ugnaught, or an Ewok to crawl through a vent.  Anakin you get right away 
 at I-5, and Wicket at VI-4.  The other four you have to buy.

"Bounty Hunter": You need to be Zam Wesell, Jango Fett, Greedo, Boba Fett, 
 Dengar, Bossk, 4-LOM, or IG-88.  You'll need them for their Thermal 
 Detonators and their ability to access green circles.

"Imperial": You need to be some kind of Imperial character to use a white 
 circle.  Any clone trooper, stormtrooper, officer, even Vader or the Emperor, 
 the first of which you can get access to in II-2, III-3, IV-1, V-2, or VI-5.  
 Commander Cody and Vader are the only ones you get for free.

"Sith": Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Vader and the Emperor have destructive Sith 
 powers which can be used on red sparklies.  Vader's the only one you get for 
 free, after VI-5.  The other three are pretty expensive.

"TIE": You need to purchase one of the TIEs to access special TIE Gates in 
 the flight missions, which you can get after IV-6, V-3, or VI-6.

"Cable Craft": You'll need the tow cable of the Snowspeeder or the Republic 
 Gunship to tow bombs around, which you get in V-1 and II-5, respectively.

Well, you'll notice I didn't bring up you needing Jedi or protocol droids.  
Since you get each in the very first mission, and there's no possibility of 
you being without them when going into Free Play, I thought it moot to mention 
them as being "required".  Also, for missions where you get certain 
characters automatically, I thought it pointless needing to take them in, as 
you will be given them no matter what (ie. I don't mention Grapplers in 
Episode I in I-3 or beyond, because you'll have some from that mission no 
matter what).

Lastly (and I know I've been going on for a while), just because I don't 
list a special requirement for a canister, it doesn't mean that you 
necessarily can get it in Story.  Sometimes, you'll have to get it on Free 
Play even if you don't need the seriously specialized characters, for one 
of two reasons: you need a simple character (like a gunner) that just doesn't 
show up in the Story (a Jedi specific level, for instance), or you need to 
utilize the Free Play effect of switching characters on the fly (such as 
grappling up to a ledge, then needing to hover across as an Artoo).

==================
6A. Negotiations =
==================

Required Character: High Jumper, Astromech, Shortie

Canister #1: As you go down the first hallway, you'll see six blue markers 
 along the walls.  Use the Force on all six and a canister will appear at the 
 end.

Canister #2: In the opening hallway, hang a left and use the Threepio panel.  
 Have two characters stand on each of the buttons to uncover this one.

Canister #3 (Shortie): Midway down the first hallway (where it turns right), 
 there's a Threepio panel on your left.  It leads to a room with blocks and 
 force fields.  Send a Shortie up through the left-hand vent to find this at 
 the end of the walkway.

Canister #4 (Shortie, High Jumper): In the same area as #3, use a Shortie to 
 get through the vent to the upper ledge, then hit the button in the 
 upper-left corner, which will remove the force fields from the area.  Force 
 the four blocks on the ground into a tower, then use a high jumper to go up 
 to the upper-right for this one.

Canister #5: Similar to the one above with blue lights, there are six purple 
 lights after you turn the corner in the first hallway.  Force all six to make
 a canister appear.

Canister #6 (Astromech, High Jumper): In the same area as #5 is an Artoo panel 
 on your left.  In this next room, there is a small square cart that moves 
 forward when the Force is used on it.  Step on it and your companion will 
 move it forward.  High jump up to the canister above you.

Canister #7 (Astromech, High Jumper): In the same room as #6, go up to the 
 back vent and Force it away.  Go through it with a high-jumper.  In the next 
 room, hover across as an Artoo unit, then get onto the fighter and high jump 
 up to the canister.  The nearby Artoo panel will deactivate the force field 
 so you can go back.

Canister #8 (High Jumper): As you remove the vent leading to the second area 
 of the mission, it makes a box.  High jump off it to get this one.

Canister #9: As soon as you reach the second area, you'll see a canister above 
 a ledge to your left.  Use the Force on items on the floor to your left to 
 make a tower you can use to climb up to the ledge that has it.  You might 
 also be able to make the jump from the entrance itself.

Power Brick (Astromech, High Jumper): In the second area, force the large 
 canister on your left so you can high jump up to the Artoo panel.  Use it, 
 then go to the next room.  Step on the gray space (not the button) and your 
 buddy will step on the button.  Double jump into each of the canisters on the 
 left and right to lower them.  Once both are down, have each of you step on 
 the two new buttons to reveal the brick.

Canister #10: In the large area of the hangar on the right side, Force the big 
 block, then three little blocks on top of it.  Climb onto the over-hanging 
 platform above.  You may be able to make the jump to the canister, but it's 
 much easier to Force the lever (to the left of the magnet thingy) to move it 
 there.

=======================
6B. Invasion of Naboo =
=======================

Required Characters: Grappler, Bounty Hunter, Shortie

Canister #1 (Grappler): Take the first right to the clearing with rocks.  
 Stack the three rocks on top of each other and shoot the target.  Double jump 
 up to the canister.

Canister #2: As soon as you stand the tree up in the first area, smash it up 
 to make a canister appear.

Canister #3: This is one of the few that you can mess up on and have to go 
 back in to get.  Once you destroy the droid transport using the Force, 
 DON'T smash it.  High jump off the left end to get up to this one.

Canister #4: After smashing the droid transport on your way to the rocky 
 area, saber the whole thing into scrap.  You'll find a hole with the 
 canister underneath.

Canister #5: Once you reach the rocky steps, Force away the plants on the left 
 at the bottom of the steps to reveal a block.  Force it into the wall, then 
 have a high jumper jump off it to reach the canister.

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter): As you cross the sinking stones, you'll see a 
 green Bounty Hunter circle.  Use it to open a panel with this behind it.

Canister #6: After crossing the sinking stones that you need Jar Jar to jump 
 on, you'll find some stones on a higher platform that you can use the 
 Force on (you need to do this to proceed).  On top of that ledge is a 
 canister.

Canister #7: As you enter the third area, you Force some blocks to lower a 
 ramp.  Drop down to where you moved the blocks to to find this one.

Canister #8 (Shortie): Just before you reach the first swamp puddle.  You'll 
 see an obvious vent.  Crawl into it as a Shortie.

Canister #9: Once you reach the second swamp puddle in the third area, you'll 
 see some logs blocking a cave.  Force them away to find this one.

Canister #10: In the last area, there is a three-piece statue on the ground.  
 Force it together in the proper order: legs, body, head, and a canister 
 will appear.

=======================
6C. Escape From Naboo =
=======================

Required Characters: Astromech, Bounty Hunter, Shortie, Sith

Canister #1: In the first plaza, blast away all the doors on the ground 
 floor.  Use the Force on each of the pillars in-between to make boxes, then 
 stack the boxes.  High jump from the top of them.

Canister #2 (Astromech): In the upper plaza in the first area (with the 
 puzzle), use the Force on the back wall sections.  High jump up to the higher 
 one, then float across as an astromech to get to it in the far corner.

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter, Sith): You need to solve the "puzzle" in the upper 
 plaza in the first area.  One block is already made for you.  Another needs 
 to be assembled in the canisters in the upper left.  The third needs a 
 thermal detonator on the shiny canisters in the back right.  The last needs a 
 Sith to remove the flowers with red sparklies, then blow up the planter they 
 were in.  Once all four blocks are assembled, they need to be pushed to their 
 lit-up "ready" spots, and they're all in the opposite corner they need to be 
 in.  Once all four are in place, Force them to their spots on the puzzle, and 
 you're done.

Canister #3: As soon as you reach the second area, go towards the screen, 
 and it's right in front of you.

Canister #4: In the third area, after you bust out of the windows, go down 
 to the left.  When you reach the bottom ledge, go to the right and to the 
 end to find this one.

Canister #5 (Astromech, Sith): In the same basic area as #4 (down and to the 
 left in the third area), use an astromech's hover to get to the far left 
 ledge.  Grapple up to the top and use Sith Force on the flower beds, then 
 destroy them to unearth this one.

Canister #6: In the fourth area (where the Jedi come back), go to the right 
 as normal, then onto the ledges in the back of the area.  You'll eventually 
 come across a grapple point.  Grapple up and go to the left to find another 
 point, which leads to an area with little swinging gates on the ledge.  Force 
 open all of these gates to make this one appear.

Canister #7 (Shortie): In the fourth area (where the Jedi come back), go the 
 same way as #6 to the first grapple point.  There's a vent up here that a 
 shortie can go through, which leads to a canister.

Canister #8 (Shortie, Bounty Hunter): Go up the vent described in #7, then go 
 to a ledge on the right.  Drop down below you to find a balcony with shiny 
 windows.  Use a thermal detonator on those, then use the Force on the 
 painting inside to find this one.

Canister #9: In the last area there are four round trees surrounding the 
 middle skylight.  Destroy them so you can move their bases to the center.  
 Once you have all four stacked, use a high jumper to reach the canister.

Canister #10 (Bounty Hunter): In the last area, press the red button on the 
 right-hand big skylight to uncover a shiny grate covering on the right side.  
 Use a thermal detonator on it.

Other Fun Stuff:
- On the last area, the back left grating (need Sith Force) has a purple 
 stud under it, worth 10,000.

=======================
6D. Mos Espa Pod Race =
=======================

Required Vehicles: TIE

NOTE: This is still technically a race, so there is no shooting or 
 acrobatics.

Canister #1: On the main path in the first rocky area, just after a boost 
 pad.

Canister #2: Just before the drop off (which is before the service ramp), 
 you'll see it to the right of the boost pads.

Power Brick: Just after all the rocks, there's the drop off (not long before 
 the service ramp).  After that drop off, hold left to go around the holes.  
 It will be in your path.

Canister #3 (TIE): Take an Imperial Fighter through the gate up the service 
 ramp to find it.

Canister #4: In the middle of the cavern with all the crystals.  You really 
 can't miss it.

Canister #5: In the left side of the Tusken Raider canyon, between two boost 
 pads.

Canister #6: Just after the Tusken Raider canyon, after some poles.

Canister #7: After the canyon, you'll see two holes in a rock formation.  The 
 right-hand hole has this one.

Canister #8: Soon before the open plain area, you'll have a little jump up.  
 The canister is on the right just before this.

Canister #9: In the open plains before the end, you'll find one on the right 
 side's boost pads.

Canister #10: Pretty much right before the finish line, after some poles.

=========================
6E. Retake Theed Palace =
=========================

Required Characters: Bounty Hunter, Sith

Canister #1: In the first plaza, either use a Grappler to get up to the top, 
 or Force the objects on the right side to get on the high balcony.  There's a 
 canister behind the lattice on the right side.  Just walk around the back.

Canister #2: On top of the high balcony in the first plaza, in the center, 
 is a circular window.  Blast it open and double jump into it.

Canister #3: In the second area (with all the buttons on the floor), smash 
 the statue in the background and step on the button to uncover this one.

Canister #4 (Sith): There's a part in the second area that branches off and 
 has red lights.  Follow this area and use Sith Force on the black object on 
 the floor to move it so you can jump up to the upper ledge that has an 
 odd insignia on the wall.  Sith Force it down to find this canister.

Canister #5: In the fountain area, go to the back and use a Shortie to reach 
 the upper area (near the elevator for Artoo).  Go around to the right and 
 back to find this one.

Canister #6: This is in the fountain area, high up on the near left side.  
 To get up here, it's best to go up the Force-stairs and across the bridge.  
 Hop off to the left and use the Force on the brick-wall to get up to the 
 top.

Canister #7 (Bounty Hunter): In the area after the fountain (six buttons on a 
 high balcony), drop down the front side to find some stacked boxes.  Blow 
 them up and assemble the shiny canister.  Blow it with a thermal detonator.

Power Brick: In the dining area (with all the tables and the shiny floor), 
 go to the left side and Force together the chairs, then the tables.  Smash 
 the statue in the back and step on the button, then Force out the plates 
 and cups.  Now, blow up the whole mess to make this appear.

Canister #8: In the dining area, go to the left of the stairs up and Force 
 the two tables over to the wall on the left.  Jump into the alcove behind 
 them and grapple up.  Go left and climb up to the top ledge, then keep 
 going left to find this.

Canister #9 (Bounty Hunter, Sith): In the hangar, go to the far left (where 
 the lone pilot is) and use a thermal detonator on the shiny canisters.  Build 
 the block, then Sith Force it into place to reach this one.

Canister #10: In the hangar, in the far right upper corner.  To get there, 
 climb up to the spot where one droid is guarding two pilots.  Use a high 
 jumper from there to get up to the right ledge, then walk all the way 
 around to the corner.

Minikit: Naboo Starfighter
Power Brick Extra: Super Slap (5,000)

================
6F. Darth Maul =
================

Required Characters: Imperial, Bounty Hunter, Sith

Canister #1: In the hangar, on top of the Starfighter on the left side.  You 
 may find it easier to get to after activating it.

Canister #2: In the hangar, on top of the Starfighter on the right side.

Power Brick (Imperial): At the exit to the hangar, you'll find lifts on 
 either side of the doorway.  Hop on them and use the Force so the two 
 characters will raise each other.  Use an Imperial to get past the white 
 circle at the top.  In the next room, step on all ten of the black buttons on 
 the floor, turning them red, which will make the brick appear.  You do have 
 to be quick.

Canister #3 (Imperial, Sith): In the same location as the Power Brick, use 
 Sith Force on all six lights on the walls to make this appear.

Canister #4 (Bounty Hunter): In the second area, go to the very end of the 
 ground floor area and use a thermal detonator on the shiny wall.

Canister #5: Use a grappler in the second area at the grapple point to reach 
 the top area (with the ton of studs), then go all the way around to the 
 right.  Hop on the yellow lift and use the Force on its gear three times to 
 raise it high enough to reach the canister.

Canister #6 (Imperial): When you enter the third (open) area, use an Imperial 
 on the panel to your left, then quickly hop on the platform to be carried to 
 it.

Canister #7: In the third area, there are four beams that lift you up a long 
 way.  Enter the back right beam and ride all the way up to a canister.

Canister #8: In the final room.  Use a high jumper to get on top of the 
 platform to camera right.

Canister #9: In the final room.  Once Maul activates a platform, jump on it 
 with a high jumper.

Canister #10: In the final room.  Once Maul activates another platform, jump 
 on it with a high jumper.

Power Brick Extra: Force Grapple Leap (15,000)

===========================
6G. Bounty Hunter Pursuit =
===========================

Required Vehicles: TIE

Canister #1: There are ten "light columns" dotted throughout the mission.  
 Blast them all to make this one appear.  There are six in the first flight 
 area and four in the second.  They shouldn't be too hard to spot, and they 
 make a big "#/10" when you shoot them down.

Canister #2 (TIE): Once you see your first "torpedo trolley", hang a hard 
 left and look for a TIE Gate.  It's right behind it.

Canister #3: In the first area, blast all five guns that shoot back at you 
 and you'll make this appear.

Canister #4: There's a skyscraper some ways down the first area that has 
 five blue spires on the top.  Torpedo all these.  There are ships in the 
 area that have torpedoes behind them to use.

Canister #5: Just before the first tunnel, blast the stoplight.  A tram 
 will drive by dragging a sign with a Gungan on it.  Blast it.

Canister #6: In the first force field area, find and shoot all the red 
 squares on the floor, which will raise up a canister.

Canister #7 (TIE): After the first force field area, make a hard right.  
 You'll find a TIE Gate, with this behind it.

Power Brick: After the first force field area, make a hard right.  To the 
 left of the Imperial gate are several pylons with green lights on top.  
 Shoot all of these before any of the lights shut back off and a balloon 
 will appear with the Power Brick on it.

Canister #8: In the second flying area, blast all five guns that shoot back 
 at you for this.

Canister #9: As you fly through the second area, you'll see three triangle 
 signs (near a gold circle building).  I think you have to blast all three in 
 a specific time to get this.

Canister #10: In the last force field area, shoot all the red squares to 
 raise up the canister.

=========================
6H. Discovery on Kamino =
=========================

Required Characters: Grappler, High Jumper, Imperial, Bounty Hunter, Shortie, 
 Sith

Canister #1 (High Jumper): Head to the left of your ship and Force some gears 
 onto a platform, which will raise up.  High jump to reach the canister.

Canister #2: Send an astromech back behind your ship to hover across the 
 stud chain to the canister.

Canister #3 (Bounty Hunter): After seeing the clone army, instead of going the 
 usual left, go right.  Open the door with a bounty hunter.  In the next room, 
 hop onto the button and wait for your partner to hop on the other.  Continue 
 this until you lower a white mass.  Force the elevator open so you can jump 
 up to the canister.

Canister #4 (Bounty Hunter, Shortie): From #3, shoot the target on the back 
 wall, then head to this back area.  The trick here is that you enter one of 
 the vents as a shortie, but end up in a different capsule above.  If you 
 enter the far right one, you'll end up in the one with the canister.

Canister #5: From the clone army area, follow Taun We down the hallway to 
 the left.  Use the Force on all six mountings on the wall to reveal this.

Power Brick (Imperial): Use an Imperial on the left hand door in the hallway 
 outside Jango's room.  In this room, step on a light and wait for your 
 partner to step on the other.  Continue this pattern until all lights are lit 
 and the disco show begins.

Canister #6: In Jango's room, go to the back right and pull the lever in 
 the corner with the Force four times to release all the bricks.  Force 
 them onto the wall to make a Jango portrait and open the hatch to this.

Canister #7: The second room you chase Jango to (he goes into the tube) has 
 circles on the floor and wall.  Step on the corresponding circle on the 
 floor that matches the one on the wall (your partner will follow suit).  Do 
 this three times to unlock the canister.

Canister #8: In the outside area where you chase Jango, turn left and hover 
 across the gap to this one.

Canister #9: In the outside area, when Jango turns and goes up to the elevator 
 in the back, go right instead to find a grapple point.  Grapple up, then use 
 the Threepio panel to lower a lift.  Hop on and shoot all three targets to 
 open the hatch to the canister.

Canister #10 (Sith): In the area where Jango releases two tubes worth of Gun 
 Pods, there's a Sith Force door on the left wall.  Enter the room and have 
 both players work the wheels on the far wall to release all the Gun Pods 
 and the canister.

===================
6I. Droid Factory =
===================

Required Characters: High Jumper, Imperial, Shortie

Canister #1: Go straight down from the beginning.

Canister #2: The second alcove on the right in the first hallway has this.

Canister #3 (Shortie): As soon as you enter the second area, before the ledge 
 recedes, hop to the left and climb up the vent to find this one.

Canister #4 (Imperial): At the end of the second area, go down towards the 
 camera from the middle fan to find another door.  Grapple up to it, shoot the 
 target, then use an Imperial on the panel.  This next room requires some 
 color combining, using the Artoo panels on the primary colors.  First, use 
 red and yellow to make orange, then yellow and blue to make green, then red 
 and blue to make purple.

Canister #5: This one is lying in plain sight in the third area, after you 
 ride the first big bucket, on the back ledge, to the left of the Artoo panel 
 door.

Canister #6: In the third area, open the Artoo panel door.  Hop across the 
 platforms to get to this one.

Canister #7: In the fourth area (where you meet Threepio and have to rotate 
 platforms), grapple along the back and you'll pretty much trip over this 
 one.

Canister #8 (High Jumper): In the fifth area (with all the Geonosians), you'll 
 find a gate made out of bricks you can smash down.  Do so, then Force the 
 remains into a platform on the left.  Use a high jumper to get up to the 
 canister high above.

Power Brick: In the fifth area (with all the Geonosians), you'll find a 
 gate made out of bricks you can smash down.  Do so, then enter the doorway.  
 In this next room, you need to hit several Artoo panels to move blast 
 shields.  It's a pretty obvious pattern.  Hitting the fourth one will allow 
 you to get the Brick.

Canister #9: At the very end of the fifth area, go down and right past the 
 exit door and this one should be quite visible.

Canister #10 (High Jumper): In the last area, use the Artoo panel on the left 
 to release some bricks you can use to make a lift and its raising mechanism.  
 Stand on it so your partner can help you up, then use a high jumper to reach 
 it.

Other Cool Stuff:
- In case you're wondering, the Artoo panel in the second area (in the 
 factory) just shuts down the machines.

Required Characters: High Jumper, Bounty Hunter, Shortie, Sith

Canister #1 (High Jumper): Near Padmé's post, high jump up to the left and 
 then the back right to find this.

Canister #2 (High Jumper): Mere inches from #1, high jump forward from the 
 back right.

Canister #3: To the right of Padmé's post, have two Force-users use the 
 levers near the gate to open it.

Canister #4: Near Anakin's post, use a grappler to get up to this one.

Canister #5: Again, mere inches from #4, grapple again to reach this.

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter): To the right of Anakin's post, use a thermal 
 detonator on the shiny object to create bricks, which you can use to build 
 small steps to the Brick.

Canister #6 (High Jumper): Near Obi-Wan's post is a grapple point and an 
 Imperial panel, which gets a lift moving, but a high jumper can also make the 
 jump quite easily.

Canister #7 (High Jumper): Right near #6, either Force together the lift on 
 the right or just high jump to it.

Canister #8 (Shortie): To the right of Obi-Wan's post, Force together a 
 platform near the vent and use a Shortie to crawl through to this one.

Canister #9 (High Jumper, Sith): In the empty alcove, use the Force to put the 
 pillar together.  You need to go in proper order of color.  The dark brown 
 goes on the bottom, then the medium brown, then the light brown, then the 
 ornate top.  Next, use Sith Force to lower the platforms, and use a high 
 jumper to reach it.

Canister #10: Just to the right of the big gate where new enemies spill out, 
 you'll find this hiding behind a pillar.

 objects to move them in front of the rock wall, then blow them up.

Canister #4: In the large hall, step on the buttons on the left to climb 
 up to this one.

Canister #5 (High Jumper): Continue climbing past #4 using a high jumper to 
 find this.

Canister #6 (High Jumper): In the large hall on the right side, use a high 
 jumper while stepping on the ledge buttons to get up to this.

Canister #7: In the second area, look for an orange container with two

6M. Battle Over Coruscant =
===========================

NOTE: I know my descriptions aren't that great, but these really aren't 
 that tough to find.  Remember, you're looking for a floating spinning 
 object.  That's your target.

Canister #1: Straight in front of you after you make the nosedive past the 
 first Republic cruiser.

Canister #2: Straight ahead as you fly past the second Republic cruiser.

Canister #3: Soon after busting apart the first shootable CIS cruiser.

Canister #4: As you pass under a Republic cruiser.

Canister #5: As you fly through a rather open space with a frigate not far 
 off to your right.

Canister #6: As you pass over the top of a Republic cruiser.

Canister #7: Just after you blow up the bridge tower on a CIS cruiser.

Canister #8: Inside the cruiser you fly through.

Power Brick: Not long after you pass through a cruiser's hangar, you'll see 
 the brick spinning on the left side of the screen.  Fly through it.

Canister #9: There's really very little to landmark this, except that it's 
 right in front of you after the Power Brick.

Canister #10: Not long before you hit the Invisible Hand (Grievous' ship), 
 you'll find this as you fly under a Republic cruiser.

Canister #1 (Grappler): In the hangar, grapple up on the right hand side to get 
 to the upper ledge where this is.

Canister #2 (Grappler): In the second area, use the obvious grapple point 
 early on to fly right through this one.

Canister #3: In the third area (with the four doors), access the far left 
 locked door (Artoo panel) to open the way to this one.

Canister #4: In the third area, access the third door from the left (Threepio 
 panel) to open the way to this one.

Canister #5: In the fourth area (thin rafters), head all the way to the left 
 to find this one easily.

Canister #6 (High Jumper): In the fourth area, there's one above the entrance.  
 Either use a high jumper, or a shortie in the vent on the right side of the 
 room.

Canister #7: After taking out Dooku, and going to the next room, go to 
 the door on the right to find this one.

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter): In the dropping elevator area, one of the vents 
 has a shiny covering.  Use a thermal detonator on it to remove its cover and 
 get this.  You'll probably find this easier to get to once you use the Artoo 
 panel to make the elevator go back up.

Canister #8: In the area after the elevator (where you cross a ledge with a 
 bunch of contraptions), there's a canister hidden behind the contraption at 
 the end.  Force it out of the way.

Canister #9: In the very last room, to the left of the entrance.

Canister #10: In the very last room, to the right of the entrance.

6O. General Grievous =
======================

Required Characters: High Jumper, Bounty Hunter

 place has a canister high above it that can be high-jumped to.

Canister #4: There's an obvious one on a low ledge near a Powerup below 
 Grievous' second hiding spot.

Canister #5: Just above #4 behind a breakable wall.

Canister #6: Go to the far right along the back ledges and down to a red 
 grapple point to find this one.

Canister #7: Grievous' third hiding place is right next to this one.

Canister #8: The bomb you move to Grievous' third hiding place has one 
 hidden right behind it.

Canister #9: Moving further right (near the natural bridge to the hidden 
 area) is where you'll find this one.

Canister #10: In the hidden building on the far right, blow away all the 
 mines to make this appear.

Power Brick: In the hidden building on the far right, use the Force on all 
 four parts of the central structure to make this appear.

=========================
6P. Defense of Kashyyyk =
=========================

Required Characters: High Jumper, Bounty Hunter, Sith

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter, Sith): In the first area, at the first junction 
 in the bridge path, take a right to get to an object that you need to Sith 
 Force.  Once you take away the outer casing, use a thermal detonator on the 
 inner part to blow it up.

Canister #1 (High Jumper): In the big tree that you climb around to get to the 
 first captured Wookiee, starting from the spot where you find him, hover to 
 the left using an astromech, then grapple to the left, then high jump to the 
 ledge with the canister.

Canister #2: In the crossroads (while saving Wookiees), go to the left, 
 to the only dead end area that doesn't have a Wookiee.  Grapple on the 
 left-hand grapple point to get this easily.

Canister #3 (High Jumper): In the beach area, high jump up on the right side.  
 You should be able to see it easily when you enter.

Canister #4 (High Jumper): In the beach area, there is a tree with some 
 platforms on it about halfway.  High jump up the platforms, then hover to the 
 right as an astromech to find this one.

Canister #5: In the beach area, there are three hidden carrots in the ground.  
 From first glance, they look just like all the other plants.  The only 
 noticable difference is that they have a larger "aura" than the rest.  You 
 need to Force all three out of the ground to make the canister appear.  
 There is one on the far right side, one on the far left, and one near some 
 rocks in the middle that is VERY tough to get without Fast Force or a 
 buddy fending off all the bad guys.

Canister #6: In the pond area with the two Commander droids, go to the 
 high ledge on the right with the Commander and you'll find this one.

Canister #7 (High Jumper): In the pond area, Force the downed ARC Fighter up 
 out of the swamp, then quickly switch to a high jumper and jump up from the 
 ship to this one.

Canister #8 (Sith): In the forested area with the slanted ledges, there is a 
 black plant you need to use Sith Force on, which reveals a grapple point.  
 Grapple up, then hover over with an astromech to the right to get this.

Canister #9: As you climb up the ramps with the rolling rocks, you'll see a 
 grapple point.  Grapple up and you'll hop into this one.

Canister #10 (High Jumper): In the last area, raise up Yoda's little ship, but 
 don't open it, yet.  High jump on top of it, then up to the canister.

======================
6Q. Ruin of the Jedi =
======================

Required Characters: High Jumper, Bounty Hunter, Sith

Canister #1: From the beginning, go straight back and to the right.  This 
 one should be obvious.

Canister #2 (High Jumper): About halfway to the stairs, there is some 
 rubble out in front that is actually three boxes.  Force them all into a 
 stack, then high jump from the top.

Canister #3 (Sith): Beneath one of the objects on the far right of the 
 stairs is a grapple point.  Go up to the window above the big door and 
 use Sith Force on the window to uncover some pieces.  You may have to 
 destroy some things first, but in the end, you can build the canister.

Canister #4: After climbing the red stairs in the second area, use the 
 white circle and enter the room.  You'll find this in the projector.  You 
 have an Imperial in Commander Cody if you need it.

Canister #5: Instead of heading for the archives, go down the stairs 
 towards the council chamber.  To the left of the door is a canister out 
 in midair.  Hover to it with an astromech.

Canister #6: Instead of heading for the archives, go down the stairs and into 
 the council chamber.  Force all the seats into a stack and climb up to the 
 top to find this one.

Canister #7 (High Jumper): In the large archive chamber, go to the rightmost 
 alcove on the right side, and above the lever you should see this one.  
 High jump to get it.

Canister #8: In the large archive chamber, go to the leftmost alcove on the 
 right side and above the lever you should see this one.  You can pull out 
 platforms to get up to it.

Canister #9 (High Jumper): In the large archive room, once you move the 
 three levers, the platform blocking the door will shift to a flat position.  
 High jump onto it, then to the ledge in the back of the room.  Move around to 
 the left, then hover over the force field in the alcove on the left side and 
 drop down to get this one.

Power Brick (High Jumper): After getting #9, use the Threepio panel to lower 
 the force fields on the left-side alcoves.  Use the Force to pull out 
 platforms, then high jump up to all the levers (one needs a button to lower 
 a force field).  Once all three levers are pulled, a platform moves to 
 the upper left ledge.  Climb back up there and high jump up to the brick.

Canister #10 (Bounty Hunter, Sith): In the last room, use a thermal 
 detonator on the left-hand panel, and Sith Force on the right-hand one.  
 Stepping on both buttons at once lowers the force field in front of the 
 shiny boxes.  Thermal detonate them, then build a lever and pull it.

 studs.

Canister #3: In the second room, smash yellow bricks in the back left to 
 uncover this.

Canister #4: Just south of #4, flip the lever to find this one.

Power Brick: On the left side of the second room, use the Artoo panel to 
 open the door to the brick.

Canister #5: In the front left of the second room.  Flip both levers to 
 blow up the screen, uncovering this one.

Canister #6: Right behind you as you enter the third area.

Canister #7: Right in your path in the third area as you hop across 
 platforms.

Canister #8: In the last big lava area, on the right side of the room.

Canister #9: In the last big lava area, on the left side of the room.

Canister #10: In the last big lava area, in the very back right of the room.  
 The best way to get there is to hover from the big pillar leading to 
 the last rock.

==================
6S. Secret Plans =
==================

Required Characters: Imperial, Bounty Hunter, Sith

Canister #1 (Sith): Just as you exit the first two rooms, the Rebel 
 Troopers will be leaving from a door, which has a red aura.  Bust it down.

Canister #2 (Bounty Hunter): In the first room with grapple points,  toss a 
 TD onto the shiny module to blow open the floor.  The small character panel 
 is a red herring.

Canister #3: At the top of the room with grapple points, use the Force to move 
 two platforms into place, then hop up.

Canister #4 (Bounty Hunter OR Imperial): Use the green circle or white circle 
 to access a hallway.  At the end, enter the two pods to toss out pieces.  
 Assemble them into a door.

Canister #5 (Bounty Hunter OR Imperial): There are three pieces with grapes 
 on them to be found.  The first is right in front of the green circle door, 
 the second is in the hallway behind it, and the third is behind a Threepio 
 shield in that hallway.  Get them all to make the canister appear near where 
 #4 is.

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter OR Imperial): In the same area as Canisters 4 and 5, 
 continue ahead through the door to reach a shower area.  Force the nearest 
 one on the right to create plants, which can be destroyed to find the brick.

Canister #6: In the room with push blocks, Force two containers on top of each 
 other and double jump up above.

Canister #7: Whose dumb idea was this one?  Just after the first Threepio 
 panel, use the Force on the first upper-left panel to open a secret door.  
 It's hard to distinguish this one from the others.

Canister #8 (Bounty Hunter): In the same area as Canisters 4 and 5, blow up 
 the shiny module with a TD to find the parts for a car.  Drive it all the 
 way to the crane room and onto the lift.  You can also use the milk truck 
 you can create in the shower room (same room as Power Brick).

Canister #9 (Imperial, Bounty Hunter): Early in the last room, behind a wall 
 on the left side, is a flower.  Behind the white circle door is another.  
 In a shiny module later in the hallway is the third.  Find all three to 
 make the canister appear.

Canister #10 (Sith): In the bath in one of the escape pods is a plug that a 
 Sith needs to drain.  Do so.

Other Cool Stuff:
- There's not much in it, but the first Threepio panel has a goofy 
 perspective room.

Power Brick Extra: Super Blasters (15,000)

=================================
6T. Through the Jundland Wastes =
=================================

Required Characters: Bounty Hunter, Sith, Shortie

Power Brick (Bounty Hunter): Just after the bantha area, on the right are two 
 shiny structures.  Hover over there and use TDs to blow them away.  This is 
 the Tusken Village.  Near you on the right are three boxes.  Make a tower 
 out of them and hop up to the rock.  Hover over to the far rock and push the 
 mine cart down the slope so it rolls into the wall, breaks it, and uncovers 
 the brick.  If you have trouble getting over there with the structures 
 intact, or have a hard time throwing TDs, you can also use the Droid Self-
 Destruct, which gives the same kind of explosion.

Canister #1 (Bounty Hunter): In the Tusken Village (see above), use the Force 
 to raise the mound of dirt so you can hop up.  Continue over to the cliffs 
 and hover across.

Canister #2 (Sith): Just past the first chasm is a wall that can be Forced 
 down by a Sith.  Build a charge to blow open the rock wall.  Go inside and 
 put together and use another charge on the next rock wall so you can double 
 jump up the ledges to the canister.

Canister #3 (Shortie): Put together and use the first grapple point, float 
 across, and crawl through the vent.

Canister #4 (Bounty Hunter, Shortie): At the top of the sandcrawler, use a TD 
 on the nine caps to the left.  Two of those cover buttons.  Step on both to 
 raise a vent you can crawl through.

Canister #5: Inside the Sandcrawler, once you're in the room with the pushable 
 boxes, push one into the slot on the right to free the canister.

Canister #6 (Sith, Shortie): In the room of the Sandcrawler after the 
 elevator, you'll find a console near one of the two gates.  Sith Force it to 
 open a vent to crawl through.  Once out, have both characters step on the 
 buttons, then Force the valve, then the structure above it to stop the lava 
 flow.  You can make the jump across if you use the lava output, but it's 
 easier to hover across.

Canister #7: In the first vaporator area, put together the grapple point, 
 then Force the hook into position so you can grapple up to this one.

Canister #8 (Sith): In the first vaporator area, you'll find supports that 
 need to be Sith Forced.  Go up to this area.  There are two buttons that 
 need to be held down, but one's pretty big.  Finally, a use for banthas as 
 you can steer one onto the big one, then step on the other yourself.

Canister #9: Further down the canyon, after the vaporators, is a pillar, 
 just after the bones you need to make into a bridge.  Step onto that pillar 
 to lower it, revealing this one.

Canister #10: Put together a landspeeder and take it up to the big mud bog up 
 north.  Go to the rocks with the canister and put together the grapple point.  
 Grapple up, then hop over to the canister.

Other Cool Stuff:
- The Threepio panel first in the Sandcrawler leads to a TV room.  Put it 
 together to get some neat shots of "elsewhere".

==========================
6U. Mos Eisley Spaceport =
==========================

Required Characters: Imperial, Bounty Hunter, Sith, Shortie

Power Brick: To the left of the door out of the first area are four garbage 
 cans.  Use the Force on all four to remove their lids, then again to remove 
 all the parts inside.  Once all the parts are out, assemble the door.

Canister #1 (Imperial): To the right of your starting point is a white circle 
 door.  Once inside, use the Force on both faucets of both showers to drain 
 the pool.

Canister #2 (Bounty Hunter): Okay, go up to the Double Score Zone, then hover 
 across the broken bridge to the left.  Access the green circle to loose a 
 bunch of bricks you can put together into a fan system.  Now, you need to 
 find three carrots that are in garbage cans.  There's one by the beginning, 
 one further out on the left, and one further out on the right.  Just bust 
 everything open and you should have it.  Once you have all three, float up 
 on the fans to the canister.

Canister #3 (Sith): In the upper right part of the first area is an obvious 
 object to use Sith Force on.  Blow it up and drop down.

Canister #4: In the second area, stack two crates to climb up to this 
 obvious one.

Canister #5: In the second area, either use an AT-ST, or use the white circle 
 near the door in the first area with an Imperial to hop up near the nearest 
 rubble gate.  Put together the two blaster chairs, then hop in and start 
 bulls-eyeing womprats.  Peg ten and get your prize.

Canister #6 (Bounty Hunter): Near the crooked wrecked ship in the second 
 area is a shiny vaporator.  TD it to reveal the parts for a rotator switch, 
 which will straighten the ship and drop a grapple point.  Grapple up and 
 double jump to the canister.

Canister #7 (Shortie): In the cantina, crawl in the vent in one of the back 
 alcoves.

Canister #8: The only real requirement for this one is that you do it on 
 Free Play, because you at least need Threepio.  You need to get into a 
 back area by either a green circle door, a Threepio panel, or Sith gates 
 in the dewback area after the cantina.  Back here there's a cell-type thing.  
 You'll need two Force users to open one of the gates to get to this one.

Canister #9: You need to find three big radishes.  One is right outside the 
 back door of the cantina, another is in the area mentioned in Canister #7, 
 and the third is in the dewback area.  Bust down the garbage cans hiding 
 these and a canister will appear in the block pushing area.

Canister #10: Use Artoo at the movie theater to let yourself in.  Once you 
 put together the movie screen, shoot it down.

Other Cool Stuff: 
- Bring your Landspeeder through the wash, then over to the lot.  A Jawa 
 will drop off studs to buy it.

6V. Rescue the Princess =
=========================

Required Characters: Shortie, Sith

Canister #1: Turn right just after the first area to find a crane.  Use the 
 crane to dump stormies and troopers into the hole in the hangar.  Once you 
 dump ten, pick up the canister as well.

Canister #2: In the control room, use the Threepio panel to find one in the 
 closet.

Canister #3: You need to enter the "Ben Area" by crossing the large pit with a 
 Jedi or Artoo, then turn left to find one at a dead end.

Canister #4 (Shortie): Still in the Ben Area, hover across to the right, then 
 grapple up and crawl through the vent.

Canister #5: Continue on in the Ben Area to the tractor beam controller.  
 Force the bridge over to the other side, then pull all three levers and 
 grapple up to the canister.

Canister #6 (Sith): Continue on to the next part of the Ben Area and Sith 
 Force the door into platforms.  Hop up onto them to another canister.  Be 
 careful because there's an invisible ceiling on the causeway itself.  You 
 need to jump out over the pit to get some height.

Power Brick: Partway up the normal path is an Artoo panel.  Enter the room, 
 hover over to the left side, then grapple up.

Canister #7: In the room with the rotating bridge, just before dropping down 
 in front of the door to the next room, hover across to this canister.

Canister #8: In the room with control panels and stormtroopers (after the 
 rotating bridge), destroy all the control panels and the TV will start 
 working.  A canister will pop up, then.

Canister #9: Just before the elevator to the cell block, Force three blocks 
 into a tower, then climb up and push the module into the hole to free this 
 canister.

Canister #10: Use Threepio on the last cell on the left to find this.

Canister #1 (Bounty Hunter): Just after the first helmet dispenser, use a TD 
 on the brick wall to find one.

Canister #2 (Shortie): In the first big room, go down to the enclosure with 
 the floor waxer and crawl through the vent.

Canister #3: After the first big room, you'll see two stormies cleaning a 
 window.  Hop in the crane and use it to cover all the dirty spots.  Once 
 they're all gone, the window will break and you'll get another one.

Canister #4 (Sith): After the window room, you'll eventually come upon a 
 panel for Siths.  Break it open for another one.

Canister #5: After climbing around the causeway and getting an elevator in 
 motion, at the top, near the white circle, is an object that can be Forced 
 into a platform.

Canister #6: After the big pit with the swinging across, go towards the 
 camera and hop out the window to the left.

Canister #7: After the big pit, you'll find orange tanks on the side of the 
 passage.  Each one has a "grape piece" in it.  Find all three to make this 
 one appear.

Canister #8: In the room with the ton of stormtroopers, Force two boxes into 
 a stack, then double jump up to the catwalk above.

Canister #9 (Bounty Hunter): In the last room, near Vader, use a Bounty 
 Hunter on the green circle.

Canister #10: After opening the door with Artoo and Threepio, you'll find one 
 in their room.

Canister #1: After the first shield gate, there will be a red and green 
 spinner to your left.  Blast it to raise a cage that has the canister.

Canister #2: Near the first quad target, you'll see four blue strips lined up 
 on the right wall.  Blast them all and behind them is the canister.

Canister #3 (TIE): To the left of the second shield gate is an area only 
 accessible to TIEs.  Drop a torp at the target to find the next canister.

Canister #4 (TIE): Halfway up after the second shield gate on the left side 
 is another TIE Gate.  Within it are several green squares.  Fly over all 
 these green squares quickly to get another canister.

Canister #5: Just in front of that Imperial gate is another spinner.  Spin 
 it to reveal another canister.

Canister #6: Further up near the third shield gate, and to the right, is 
 yet another Imperial gate.  Just to the right of that gate is another 
 series of blue bars.  Blast them open to get another canister.

Canister #7 (TIE, Cable Craft): Before the third shield gate, there are two 
 TIE Gates on the right side.  One has a towable bomb, and the other has an 
 electric field.  Open both gates first, then tow bombs into either side of 
 the electric field.

 track, hop up onto it, then to the ledge with the canister.  Alternatively, 
 you can just double jump.

Canister #3: In the room where you find Threepio, there are four buttons.  
 You can come back to this room when you have four people, or use a Bounty 
 Hunter's TDs to blow the modules and create generators to free the skeletons 
 who will work for you as well.

Canister #4: In the large room with push blocks, by the exit door, Force 
 away the rubble to make a snowman, then push a block into the slot near

 midair.  Push a box close if you can then double jump into it.

Canister #8 (Bounty Hunter): Go to the Threepio door in the small room with 
 four buttons and two blocks.  Use a TD on the rubble, then go through the 
 door and Force the control panel near the canister to free it.

Canister #9 (Sith, Shortie): There are four panels you can turn into steps 
 with Sith Force before the hangar.  It's tough to scale them, but it's 
 doable.  At the top, go left and grapple up.  Crawl through the vent up here.

Canister #10 (Sith): Go up the same platforms you went to Canister 8, only go 
 right this time.  Use the Artoo panel.  There are levers in this room that 
 do a sort of slot machine thing.  Pull the lever on the green and yellow

Canister #1: Stack the three boxes, then climb up to the tree branch and hop 
 over to the one on the right.

Power Brick (Sith): In the first area, use Sith Force on the black plants, 
 then jump across the gap.  Walk to the race track and bust the box to find 
 a tractor to assemble.  Roll the tractor over all the red lights to make 
 them green.  Do it quickly.

Canister #2: In the center of the first big pond, in the blue box.  A double 
 jump can cross from the Artoo panel to the rock on the left side, then 
 up to the big rock.

Canister #3 (Sith, Bounty Hunter): To the right of Yoda's Hut is a red box 
 that you need to Sith Force.  Build the remains into a raft, then float 
 across to the island.  Use a TD on the back wall.

 to the cave), there's an obvious grapple point leading to this one.

Canister #7 (Sith, Bounty Hunter): Inside the cave, use Sith Force on two 
 parts of a bridge, then blow containers with a TD to make a grapple point.

Canister #8: There's a Threepio panel before the ledges.  You actually don't 
 need it, as you can just double jump over to the nearby window, then strike 
 the cage.

Canister #9 (Bounty Hunter): Just before the Vader fight area, use a TD on 
 the rubble on the right wall.  Watch out for the falling parts of the floor 
 and cross to the canister.

Canister #2 (Bounty Hunter): Use the green circle door just after the E-Web 
 room.

Canister #3 (Sith): Not a very intuitive one.  Sure, you can figure out to 
 use the lever in the carbon freezing chamber, but to drop a stormtrooper 
 in there?  That takes thinking outside the nine dots.

Canister #4: After the carbon freezing chamber, put together the fan, ride 
 up, and gun down the wall above the canister to make a platform to double 
 jump up to.

Canister #5: You can see one in the same room as #4 at the second fan, but it 
 won't blow you up high enough.  Simply activate the elevator to the right 
 and hover over to it.

Canister #6 (Shortie): In your second duel against Vader, there is a vent you 
 can crawl through.

Canister #7 (Bounty Hunter): In the third duel against Vader (with 
 stormtroopers and flying objects), use a TD in the corner that's obviously 
 LEGO bricks.

Canister #8: The most obvious one in the game.  Right to the left in the last 
 area.

Canister #9: Second-most obvious one.  Right after #7, double jump towards the 
 camera to find another one.

Canister #10 (Imperial): Right before the end is a white circle door with the 
 canister behind it.

NOTE: Vader counts as both a Sith and Imperial, so I won't bother mentioning 
 needing one for particular spots, and you also still have Wicket.

Power Brick: Sith Force the eight red lights flanking the Emperor's throne.  
 Do it quickly and the brick will appear above the throne.

Canister #1: Force together the platform to the left of the throne and hop up.

Canister #2 (Bounty Hunter): Go down the steps and to the right.  Use a TD 
 on the containers to reveal a grapple point.  Grapple up.

Canister #3 (Bounty Hunter): In the central elevator, toss a TD onto one of 
 the vertical shiny strips to uncover this one.

Canister #4 (Bounty Hunter): Use the green circle to make a Threepio panel 
 behind you.  Use it to open a secret door.

Canister #5: Go on the area to the right of the throne area (the elevator).  
 Crawl through the vent and push the box off the ledge.  Blast the items to 
 blow open the door and enter a new area.  In this area, stack three chairs

Canister #6 (Bounty Hunter): In the same area as #5, use Sith Force, then a 
 TD on the fan in the back left to free another canister.

Canister #7: In the same area as #5, uncover a grapple point near the door.  
 Then pull the lever at the top to drop a box.  Assemble it and push it onto 
 the green circle.  Next, bust up the nearest chair and assemble the rotator 
 switch to rotate the box.  Now, push the box all the way around and into 
 the arrows to start up a lift.  Now, go left of the door you came in by 
 and smash up some stuff to uncover a Threepio panel.  Activate it to lower 
 a platform to a lever in the back right of the room.  Hop on the lift and 
 go right.  Pull the lever to uncover the canister below you.

Canister #8 (Bounty Hunter): Go to the area left of the throne room (under 
 the electric floor).  Use Sith Force on the vent on the right, then assemble

 Hop up the step to the platform, then hover across to the canister.

Canister #9 (Bounty Hunter): In the same area as #8, go through the door, 
 and remove all the wall-coverings using thermal detonators, then walk over 
 all twelve air vents to make a canister appear above the pit.

Canister #10 (Bounty Hunter): This is a long one.  Its spot is above the 
 door leading to the separate area, and it's flanked by four lights that you 
 need to turn on.  For the first, go to the middle area and toss a TD onto 
 one of the shiny parts of the wall to find a white circle.  Use it, which 
 will deploy some bricks near the light second from the left.  For the 
 second, up on the electric floor area, quickly use Sith Force on all ten red 
 lights to make some bricks off to the right (the way you came here), which 
 make a green circle.  This will create bricks in front of the light second 
 from the right.  For the third and fourth go to elevator area (last part of 
 the fight) and smash everything up on the top to find parts for the last 
 two.  These last two you need to use Sith Force or a TD on.  Once all four 
 lights are assembled and uncovered, Force them all to get the final Canister.

******************************************************************************
7. CHALLENGE RUNTHROUGHS
******************************************************************************

This new mode tasks you with going into each mission and finding ten blue 
canisters.  You will have ten minutes to find them all on most missions.  They 
are NOT in the same areas as the canisters in Story/Free Play.  Once you find 
all ten, the mission will end, and your best time will be recorded.

As general tips, I suggest searching in alcoves or behind things that you 
normally wouldn't expect to look.  Some of the hiding places can be quite 
devious.  However, none of them are "invisible" hidden, as in, you don't 
need to perform any special tasks to get them to appear, so try to save as 
much time as possible by not manipulating useless objects.

Note that you will NOT have access to Extras.  You will, however, be given 
the standard Free Play set of characters.  I suggest taking a Ghost Jedi 
with you, as they won't be bothered by enemies.  Also, to save time, keep 
track of how many "shifts" you are from your astromech, protocol, high 
jumper, etc.

Upon completing a Challenge, you'll get your remaining time in studs, as 
well as an extra 50,000 the first time you do it.  Nothing else, though.

 middle and build a rotator.  Move the box onto the rotator and turn it so 
 the arrow points right.  Push the box all the way to the right side, and

******************************************************************************
8. BOUNTY HUNTER CHALLENGES
******************************************************************************

To access these, you must have unlocked all the following six Bounty Hunters: 
Greedo, Bossk, Dengar, IG-88, 4-LOM, and Boba Fett.  Your objective in these 
missions is to take these six hunters and scour the level and look for your 
intended target, who's hiding somewhere.  The target's always in the same 
location.  You have three minutes to find them, or else you'll have to start 
again.

As a general tip, I'd stick with Boba Fett for the majority of the missions.  
He has a powerful gun and can use his jetpack to float.  IG-88 and 4-LOM 
have their uses too, as, being droids, they can use either droid panels.

Another good tip is to watch for the character's emblem to appear on the 
bottom of the screen.  As it start's flashing, you'll know you're getting 
close.

After you finish a mission, you'll get a gold brick and credit for your 
remaining time.

==================
8A. Qui-Gon Jinn =
==================

Area: Droid Control Ship (Negotiations)

Go straight out into the hallway.  When the hallway turns right, go to the 
left and open the door with the Threepio panel with IG-88 or 4-LOM.  
Qui-Gon is right there.

===================
8B. Queen Amidala =
===================

Area: Theed Palace (Escape from Naboo)

Switch to Boba Fett.  Drop down to the lower floor, then head right and hop 
onto the back ledges.  Go up the first grapple point, then use Fett's 
jetpack to hover over to the right, to the balcony with shiny windows.  She's 
standing right there.

===================
8C. Jar Jar Binks =
===================

Area: Forests of Naboo (Invasion of Naboo)

Head straight right, up the ramp, and to the first swamp area.  Throw a 
thermal detonator at the droid transport on the back wall and go to the 
back area.  Jar Jar's here.

================
8D. Mace Windu =
================

Area: Geonosis Mountains (Droid Factory)

Head to the right and bust down the bricks blocking the passage to the back.  
Use a droid on the first Artoo panel to uncover the way to Mace Windu.

===============
8E. Kit Fisto =
===============

Area: Kamino (Discovery on Kamino)

Switch to Fett, head left, then jetpack across to the platform.  Now THAT 
was easy.

==============
8F. Luminara =
==============

Area: Geonosis Arena (Jedi Battle)

Go to the right a little and you should see her behind the gate.  All you 
have to do is use the green circle and you're in.

==================
8G. Ki-Adi Mundi =
==================

Area: The Invisible Hand (Chancellor in Peril)

Head straight back, then turn right.  Go to the door on the far right and 
use a TD on the shiny box to lower the ramp to the next area.  In this area, 
switch to Fett and jump and jet to the left all the way to Ki-Adi's hiding 
spot.

===================
8H. Rebel Trooper =
===================

Area: Wookiee Village (Defense of Kashyyyk)

Blast the two sides of the bridge to drop it, then head across to the next 
bridge.  Blast that down, then move on to the big tree (a Wookiee was held 
captive here).  Switch to Fett, then grapple up to the Wookiee's capture 
spot, then jetpack left to continue around the tree.  Grapple to the left to 
find him.

==============
8I. Shaak Ti =
==============

Area: Jedi Temple (Ruin of the Jedi)

Head to the right and you should see her hanging out on a ledge above the 
main door.  Head right past the door and blast the containers to find a 
grapple point.  Switch to Fett (he jumps a bit higher than the others) and 
grapple up.  Walk around the ledge and jump up to Shaak Ti's spot.

====================
8J. Commander Cody =
====================

Area: Utapau (General Grievous)

Switch to Fett, then head back across the bridge, then turn left and jetpack 
over to the left.  Use a TD on the shiny wall.  Cody's right behind it.

===========
8K. R2-D2 =
===========

Area: Tantive IV (Secret Plans)

Grapple up to the top and jetpack across to the next area, then run straight 
ahead.  Turn right and hit the green circle, then go back to the end of the 
hallway.  Hop in the two pods to toss out their pieces, then assemble them to 
make the door.  Artoo's right there.

====================
8L. Obi-Wan Kenobi =
====================

Area: Sandcrawler (Through the Jundland Wastes)

Proceed all the way through the Sandcrawler.  Use 4-LOM or IG-88 for the 
droid panels you come across, but watch out for Jawas, who'll zap you and 
slow you down.  At the last room in the Sandcrawler, bust up the canisters 
to the right to find Ben.

===============
8M. Chewbacca =
===============

Area: Mos Eisely (Mos Eisley Spaceport)

Grapple up and assemble the grapple point.  Grapple up and use the top exit.  
Get the box from the other side and push it to the far door.  In the next 
area, go to the doors with blue sparklies and bust down the left ones.  
Chewie's behind there.

===================
8N. Princess Leia =
===================

Area: Death Star (Rescue the Princess)

Leia is in the cell just opposite the one she normally occupies.  Use Fett 
to quickly jet through the first area, then plow straight ahead past the 
control station and down the corridor to the last elevator.  Put together the 
levers and pull, then take the third cell on the left.

====================
8O. Admiral Ackbar =
====================

Area: Echo Base (Escape from Echo Base)

Quickly turn left and access the Threepio panel with one of the droids.  In

the console to find Ackbar inside.

==========
8P. Yoda =
==========

Area: Ewok Village (The Battle of Endor)

Quickly go left and hover over the gap of the bridge.  Near the throne, 
blow the purple boxes and assemble the rotator switch.  Lower the platform, 
then jet over to it carefully.  Yoda's right at the top.

===========
8Q. C-3PO =
===========

Area: Cloud City (Betrayal On Bespin)

He's on top of the secret terrace.  Proceed straight through the level.  Use 
the green circle door, then go straight ahead and use the Threepio door.  
Go all the way to the two elevators and use the left-hand one.  Oddly enough, 
you can assemble him in the junk area, just like before, but it won't give 
you credit.

======================
8R. Lando Calrissian =
======================

Area: Cloud City (Betrayal On Bespin)

He's in the room that you pulled levers to bridge to the Falcon.  Assemble 
the grapple point, then switch to a droid and activate the panel at the 
door.  Go all the way to the end, through the fog, to the room with the 
levers.

====================
8S. Luke Skywalker =
====================

Area: Mos Eisely (Mos Eisley Spaceport)

He's on top of the wrecked ship.  Simply use a TD on the shiny module in 
the center, assemble the rotator switch, then rotate it, assemble the grapple 
point, and up you go.

==============
8T. Han Solo =
==============

Area: Echo Base (Escape from Echo Base)

He's in the area with the cart on the track.  Go to the door out of there, 
put together the bomb, then move ahead.  Assemble the heater and shoot it to 
melt the ice.  Push the next heater into place to melt the next ice, then 
turn right at the crossroads and use a TD on the boxes at the end.  Assemble 
the cart and ride it around to the right-hand alcove and jump up.

******************************************************************************
9. EPISODE BONUS MISSIONS
******************************************************************************

Once you complete all six missions of an episode, you'll gain access to the 
Bonus Missions in that particular episode.  Each episode has three bonus 
missions, all with the same general theme for each episode.

NOTE: You will no longer get Gold Bricks for Super Story, but you will get 
percentage of the game complete.

---

Super Story

Each episode bonus has this as their first selection.  You basically go 
through all six chapters as fast as possible and collect as many studs as 
possible.  You don't get anything for doing this, mind you, besides 
percentage of the game complete.  It's just a race to see if you can get 
through it with good records.

---

Character Bonus

These missions put you in characters, then drop you in a specialized area 
and challenge you with getting one million studs.  You'll get a standard Free 
Play set of characters.  Sadly, you cannot keep the studs you gather here, 
but if you beat the time limit, you get a Gold Brick.

Of course, you won't be completely free to just hunt for studs, as multiple 
enemies will harrass you no matter where you are.

With the inclusion of Powerups, the whole experience becomes much easier, 
not only with the ability to draw in more studs, but also the double count 
while it's active.

Be on the lookout for purple studs, as they'll give you 10,000.  These can 
most often be found in shiny objects that you would need a thermal detonator 
for.

Good Extras to use for these would be Exploding Blaster Bolts (but be 
careful to try not to shoot when surrounded by enemies) for shiny stuff, 
Super Jedi Slam, Force Grapple Leap, and of course, Invincibility or Deflect 
Bolts to remove the pain of enemies.

---

Minikit Bonus

Much like Character Bonuses, these have you collecting one million studs.  
The only difference is that you'll be using vehicles you make from minikits.  
You cannot access these until you make at least one complete vehicle.  Get 
one million within the time limit and you get a Gold Brick.

General tips in these are to look for torpedo targets, as they'll tend to 
give you the most studs, as well as a good chance for Powerups.

Good Extras to use for these would be Infinite Torpedoes and Tractor Beam.

---

The following Extras are disallowed in both Character Bonus and Minikit Bonus:
Poo Money, Stud Magnet, Character Studs, and all multipliers.

=====================
9A. Episode I Bonus =
=====================

Character Bonus (Theed Palace)

This is a pretty easy one to begin with.  Even regular containers will drop 
a purple stud or two on occasion, so shoot and saber to your heart's content.  
It's also a big area, so don't worry about hemming yourself in.

---

Minikit Bonus (Tatooine)

This is a large rocky area.  Rocks and pylons all over the place make 
collecting a breeze.  The torpedoes are in the lower right corner, but you 
don't even really need them, studs are so plentiful.

======================
9B. Episode II Bonus =
======================

Character Bonus (Geonosis)

This area is a connection of walkways and moving buckets.  Ride any bucket 
around for a large amount of studs (but it's a little slow).  There are 
shiny containers dotted around for a good chance of a Powerup.

---

Character Bonus (Coruscant)

This is a diagonally connecting series of skyscrapers in the city of 
Coruscant.  Like always, torpedo targets have the best chance of powerups, 
so search the southernmost area for the torpedoes.

=======================
9C. Episode III Bonus =
=======================

Character Bonus (Mustafar)

This is a series of platforms in the lava of Mustafar.  There are shiny 
containers at the corners, which will most likely have Powerups, so focus 
on those.

---

Minikit Bonus (Kashyyyk)

The forest and beach on Kashyyyk has a few torpedo targets, and the torps 
are on the right side.  Keep blasting plants, rocks, whatever's not nailed 
down.

======================
9D. Episode IV Bonus =
======================

Character Bonus (Mos Eisley)

For Mos Eisley, quickly get into a bounty hunter and start dropping TD's on 
the shiny modules.  That's several purples easy.  Just keep moving and 
tossing, collecting wherever you can.

---

Minikit Bonus (Death Star)

On the Death Star, shoot all the dishes and guns.  In particular, look for 
the four-part structure on the lower end.  It gives you a LOT when you fire 
four torps into it.  After hitting that big one, simply fly around blasting, 
looking for powerups, as those make life so much easier.

=====================
9E. Episode V Bonus =
=====================

Character Bonus (Bespin)

The Ep V version puts you in Bespin, upon a bunch of catwalks.  Take Boba 
Fett, so you can have his powerful gun, jetpack, and TDs.  Hunt around for 
things you can TD for the most studs and highest possibility of powerups, 
then, when you get a big crowd behind you, toss a TD at them, for a good 
boost.  Probably the best location is at the south end.  There are two 
platforms with TD-able containers next to each other.  Just keep walking 
back and forth between the two to harvest them.

---

Minikit Bonus (Hoth)

This arena is on Hoth, in a circular area.  There are torps at one end, and 
a torp target at the other, which is what you should focus on.  You COULD 
use towable bombs with a Snowspeeder, but it's largely useless, and takes 
far too much time.  Just circle the area, pick up torp, blast target, 
repeat.  It's even easier with infinite torps.  Cirdan tells me an even 
EASIER route.  Switch between Droideka minikit and the nearest reasonable 
ship.  Turn Self-Destruct on, then use it near the barriers to blow them up 
for LOTS of studs.

======================
9F. Episode VI Bonus =
======================

Character Bonus (Endor)

Ep VI Character Bonus is easier than Bespin.  You have a good spot.  Go far 
left over the downed bridge.  Again, take Boba Fett for his powerful gun and 
jetpack.  There's a shiny container which you can TD for massive studs, then 
head right and hide in the hut, tossing out TDs to take out any crowds that 
show up.

---

Minikit Bonus (Endor)

This area is a three-part Endor forest (which is actually pretty clear).  
There's a torpedo target in each section, and the torpedoes are in the 
right-hand section.  Focus on taking out the torp targets for the highest 
concentration of studs and highest probability of powerups.

******************************************************************************
10. CANTINA BONUSES 
******************************************************************************

Going to the far right door in the cantina, past the episode lounges, will 
bring you to this room.  In addition to the Trailers door, there are six 
Gold Brick doors.  If you have enough Gold Bricks, assemble the doors and 
you access these special missions, some of which you may have played before 
on previous games, some all new.

Passing each mission will get you a Gold Brick.

Just in case your wondering, you don't "spend" Gold Bricks in this area.  If 
you have ten under your belt, you can access all three missions that require 
ten bricks, and only need ten more to access the one for twenty, for 
example.

==========================
10A. Pod Race (Original) =
==========================

Requirement: 10 Gold Bricks

Overview: This is the original LSW's pod race, where there are three 
 portions to each lap and you need to reach the end of each portion before 
 time ran out, as opposed to just beating Sebulba.  Dying or failing to 
 pass a portion in time simply put you back at the beginning of that portion.

Vehicles: Anakin's Pod

So, you'll notice right away at the original Pod Race that the Pod doesn't 
handle the same way.  You need to hold down A to accelerate, so don't let off 
it.  Also, you'll see a green arrow as you race.  This is pointing to the 
racer you need to be ahead of at the end of the "portion" before time runs 
out, pretty much.  Watch out in the final stretch of each lap, as there are 
bombs placed to stymie you.  Lastly, you'll need to hit probably most of the 
boosters, particularly in the last lap, or else you won't make it to the end.

======================
10B. Anakin's Flight =
======================

Requirement: 30 Gold Bricks

Overview: Intended for the original LSW, but cut at the last minute, this 
 mission details young Anakin Skywalker's attack with Bravo Flight on the 
 Trade Federation Control Ship during the Battle of Naboo.

Vehicles: Naboo Starfighter
Enemies: Vulture Droid, Turbolasers

Area 1: You'll cut across the dorsal face of the Droid Control Ship.  Your 
 objective, in addition to wreaking general havoc, is to find four torpedo 
 targets and smash them.  There are two on either side of the ship.  Once 
 they're trashed, the hangar will open, so fly inside.

Area 2: You're now flying through the hangar.  Blast whatever you can.  At 
 the back end is a hangar with a red button and purple module.  Blast the 
 red, and torpedo the purple.  If you're out of torps, blast some objects to 
 see if one or two cough one up, or just go back outside (or use infinite).  
 In the next hangar, there are now four objects to shoot down, two to blast, 
 and two to torp, which opens up the next gate.

Area 3: This is the ship's main reactor.  First, you need to shoot down the 
 two wall objects powering its shield.  With that done, take three torps and 
 fire them at the gun defending the reactor to blow up its three purple 
 spots.  Now, there's a weird shield thing going on here where shields 
 extend and rotate, and you have to keep up with them.  When they go down, 
 blast the little lights on the ground near the reactor.  You'll have to 
 blast more than once to get all of them.

New Vehicles:
Naboo Starfighter

=================================
10C. Gunship Cavalry (Original) =
=================================

Requirement: 10 Gold Bricks

Overview: This is the original LSW's Gunship Cavalry, where it was far 
 more rails-oriented.  You basically travelled automatically in a diagonal 
 direction and had to gun down everything that was in your way, including 
 force fields before you crashed into them.

Vehicles: Republic Gunship
Enemies: Spider Droid, Hailfire Droid, Techno Union Ship, Turbolaser

So, in the first area, you can control your position on screen, but you're 
always shooting in an upper-right direction.  Shoot everything you can.  
Time your movements past the turbolasers.  Make sure you collect dropped 
hearts.  Being shot down will put you back at the beginning of your current 
area.  Don't fly over holes in the canyon as you'll crash.  When you find 
gates with blue force fields, shoot the two generators to drop them.  After 
the second gate, you'll pass onto the next area.

The second area has you trying to take down the Droid Control Ship.  You 
will always be facing towards the ship as you rotate around it.  You have 
one minute to clean up the area before the Ship escapes and you have to try 
again.  First, blast all the turbolasers.  Each pair shields a trio of 
modules.  Once you drop a pair of turbolasers, you can blast the modules.  
Blast all four sets of modules to down the ship.

=================
10D. A New Hope =
=================

Requirement: 20 Gold Bricks

Overview: This is the "final" bonus mission from the original LSW, meant as 
 a teaser to the upcoming LSW2.  Like "Secret Plans", this mission takes 
 place on the Tantive IV, only the player is in control of Darth Vader and 
 a Stormtrooper as they assault the ship in an attempt to capture Princess 
 Leia.

Starting Characters: Darth Vader, Stormtrooper
Added Characters: C-3PO, R2-D2
Enemies: Rebel Trooper

Area 1: Go straight ahead, blasting or sabering Rebels.  At the panel, 
 head left.  (You can also go right to find an area to spell LEGO in for 
 lots of studs).  Head all the way down the hallway to the end.

Area 2: Blast or saber all eight button-coverings, then walk over all eight 
 to free Threepio.  Head back.

Area 1: Use the Threepio panel.  Use another panel in the next room.  At the 
 junction, you can turn left to find a room where you can construct a turbine 
 to power some fans (leading to studs), or you can just go right to the 
 end.  Uncover then use the Threepio panel and step over to Leia.

================
10E. LEGO City =
================

Requirement: 10 Gold Bricks

Overview: This is the "final" bonus mission from LSW2.  This is meant as more 
 of an exercise in silliness than anything else, as it puts any of your LSW 
 characters in a more "classic" style LEGO city, complete with simplistic 
 modern houses and other "town"-related LEGOs.

This is a sort of special "Character Bonus" mission.  There's no time limit, 
but time is kept.  You need to get one million studs in this "classic" LEGO 
area.

The bad news first: you can't keep the studs, and in the entire area, there 
is very little more than the one million you need to finish.

The good news is that whenever you uncover studs, they will automatically go 
to your total, without you having to get close to pick them up.  You cannot 
lose studs, either.

Okay, here's the breakdown of objects:

Loose studs:
1. The streets to the upper-left of your starting point have studs.
2. The playground in the lower corner has loose studs.
3. On the yellow service station on the right corner.
4. On top of the red service station.
5. On top of the red tower.
6. Inside pretty much every house in the area, but you may have to bust 
 some open to get to them.

Basic Destruction:
1. All the people wandering around and the womp rats.
2. All the white fences.
3. All the green trees.
4. The bus stop near the banthas.
5. All the street lights after you put together the fans.
6. Use a thermal detonator on the shiny container near the merry-go-round 
 to find the rotator switch.  Put it together.  Turning it doesn't give you 
 anything.

Construction:
1. Plant seeds for flowers.
2. Force the flower beds near your starting point, then smash them.
3. Put together the two fans in the back right, which will light up the 
 street lights.
4. On the left corner are flowers that spring up as you walk over them.  
 Walk very carefully over the entire area.  There are 19 flowers to find, 
 after which you'll get the studs for them.
5. Along the back wall, you'll find colored blocks.  You need to spell 
 "LEGO".  The pattern is as follows:

*   *** *** ***
*   *   *   * *
*   **  * * * *
*   *   * * * *
*** *** *** ***

House by House:
1. Red Service Station and Tower - Force all the windows.  Smash the 
 roofs of each of the two garages.  There's more to do in the Wookie Flyer 
 section below.
2. Floataway House in the back right - Use a TD on the shiny container to 
 unearth the parts for an orange car.
3. Lot Full of Trees in the back - Blast all the trees to make a full 
 house.
4. Force-able House near the LEGO letters - Force away all the pieces and 
 smash the left-over pillar.  Build the miniature house.
5. Yellow Service Station - Force the glass doors and windows.  Smash the 
 yellow windows and flowers.
6. Small Red and Yellow House - Smash it to the ground, except for the 
 yellow door.  Build the tractor.
7. Black-Roofed House - Smash it all to uncover the AT-ST.
8. Red-Roof Next Door to Black Roof - Smash it all.
9. Red-Roof in the Center - Smash it all.

Vehicles:
1. Wookiee Flyer - Between the red service station and the red tower, you 
 can uncover a hole with a Wookiee Flyer in it.  Force the part near the 
 red tower onto it, then use the levers on the service station to find 
 another part to Force onto it.  Lastly, get on the nearby dewback and 
 jump from it to the top of the red tower.  Build the antennae onto the 
 flyer, then Force it out of the hole.
2. Unearth the orange car under the floataway house, then ride it around, 
 picking up all the studs that appeared.
3. At the small red and yellow house in the right corner, smash it to 
 uncover a green tractor.  Ride it around.
4. In the center red house are three trash cans.  Smash them and assemble 
 the delivery truck.  Ride it around.
5. Take any Tauntaun and ride it to find studs.
6. Smash the entire black house to uncover the AT-ST.  Naturally, the 
 AT-ST is good for smashing, but all you really need to smash with it is 
 the rubble in the very back to uncover the Landspeeder.

NOTE: The red car, the Landspeeder, the Wookiee Flyer, the AT-ST, the 
 dewback, and the banthas will NOT make studs appear when you ride them.

Anyway, once you get the million (just keep exploring), the mission will end.  
Your best time will be recorded.

===============
10F. New Town =
===============

Requirement: 50 Gold Bricks

Overview: Not to be outdone by its predecessor, the new LEGO city pulls out 
 all the stops to be just as charming and silly.

Okay, the first thing you'll notice is that this is more or less the same 
city, just at a different angle.  There are some notable changes, though.  
There's water with a boat near it, a monorail, a fire truck, a church, and a 
basketball court, among some other minor changes.

Loose Studs:
1. From the start, follow a path of studs to the boat.
2. On the playground (slide, swings, merry-go-round).
3. On top of the red service station.
4. Behind the landspeeder in its enclosure.
5. Under the bleachers at the basketball court.
6. Inside the orange service station on the right side.
7. On the monorail.  To get on, find the rotator switch near the track, 
 then turn it to get the car all the way to the beginning.  Hop from a 
 Tauntaun onto the car and ride it.
8. Inside most of the houses that you can destroy.

Basic Destruction:
1. All the people, womp rats, stormtroopers.
2. All the white fences.
3. All the green trees.
4. All the yellow benches.
5. All the ducks in the water.
6. Use a thermal detonator on the shiny container near the merry-go-round 
 to find the rotator switch.  Put it together.  Turn it to make the 
 merry-go-round fly off.

Construction:
1. Plant all the flower seeds.
2. Force all the flower beds near your starting point, then smash them.
3. Assemble the two fans.  I don't think this does anything special this 
 time.
4. In front of the church are 18 hidden flowers that you need to walk over.  
 Fourteen are on the right side of the church, and the last four are to the 
 left of the door.
5. In the back left are four letters that spell GOLE.  Look in the previous 
 LEGO City section if you want to know how to make the letters.  Once 
 they're all made, have two Force users correct their position.

House by House:
1. Lot Full of Trees in the back - Blast all the trees to make a full 
 house.
2. Floataway House - Use a TD on the shiny container inside to make an 
 orange car.
3. Force-able House near the LEGO letters - Force away all the pieces and 
 smash the left-over pillar.  Build the miniature house.
4. Orange Service Station - Force all the windows.  Smash the two glass 
 roofs over the garages.
5. Red Service Station - Force all the windows and glass doors.  Smash the 
 flowers and the windows on the right.
6. Red House in the Center - Smash it and its garbage cans.  Put together 
 the delivery truck.
7. Black-Roofed House - Smash it to uncover a giant trophy.  Use the Force 
 on that trophy several times.
8. Red and Yellow House - Smash the little thing.  Put together the resulting 
 tractor.
9. Blue Church - Put together the steeple.  Pull the lever to ring the 
 bell.  Sith Force open the door.  Drive the fire truck over to the 
 church and Force the ladder to the wall.  Grapple up to scare away the 
 bird.
10. Red House in the Back Right - Can only be destroyed with the AT-XT.
11. Basketball Court - Smash all the fences and the spectators.  Blast the 
 lightbulbs on the front of the light stands.  Grab the ball shooter and make 
 a basket.

Vehicles:
1. Take any Tauntaun and ride it to find studs.
2. Grab the fire truck and follow the trail of studs.
3. Take the AT-XT and use it to smash the red house on the right side.
4. Finally, the boat in the lower corner.  Assemble the parts to put it 
 together, then push it into the water.  Ride it around and collect all 
 the studs.

So, once again, explore and destroy.  There are some of the same tactics 
used before: bust down all the houses, Force whatever can be Forced.  The 
LEGO sign becomes "GOLE" at first, then you double Force it to the right 
formation.

As for the new stuff, to use the monorail, rotate the switch under the track, 
then hop off a Tauntaun onto the car, and wait to ride it to the end.  To 
use the boat, put together the parts near it, then push it into the water and 
ride it around.  The fire truck needs to be parked near the church so you can 
Force the ladders up to the steeple.  There's a basketball shooter in the 
court that will give you credit for making a basket.

Again, once you hit the million, your best time will be recorded.

These characters are presented in the order they appear on the Free Play 
select screen, unless they are the same character with a pallette swap.

=======================
11A. Story Characters =
======================

* Qui-Gon Jinn * - Available at beginning of game

One of the more venerable members of the Jedi Order, Qui-Gon Jinn has had a 
life much like any other Jedi Master.  Despite his abilities and positive 
attitude, he was considered by many in the order as a maverick, often going 
against the will of the Council.

Qui-Gon Jinn is a Jedi.

Abilities:
Lightsaber (main weapon)
Double Jump (press A twice)
Force (hold down Z while focused on an object with blue sparkles)
Mind Trick (press Z while focused on a non-droid enemy to stun them for a few 
 moments)

* Obi-Wan Kenobi * - Available at beginning of game
* Obi-Wan Kenobi (Jedi Master) - After II-1
* Obi-Wan Kenobi (Episode III) - After III-2
* Ben Kenobi * - After IV-2

General Kenobi is one of the great heroes of the Clone Wars.  Having started 
his life as most other Jedi going through his training, Obi-Wan grew up as 
Padawan to Qui-Gon Jinn, where he remained until Qui-Gon's death.  He then 
became Master to Anakin Skywalker, until the end of the Clone Wars.  After 
the rise of the Empire, he went into seclusion, where he observed Luke 
Skywalker, and began training him in the ways of the Jedi.

These four different Obi-Wans are the Jedi at various stages of life, first 
as a Padawan under Qui-Gon, then as a Master before the Clone Wars, then his 
shorter hair during the Clone Wars, then finally his gray hair look late in 
his life.

Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi.

Abilities:
Lightsaber (main weapon)
Double Jump (press A twice)
Force (hold down Z while focused on an object with blue sparkles)
Mind Trick (press Z while focused on a non-droid enemy to stun them for a few 
 moments)
Force Push (hold down Z while focused on a droid)

---

* TC-14 * - After I-1

A simple silver-colored protocol droid in the service of the Trade Federation, 
it was TC-14 who escorted Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to the conference room when 
they arrived aboard the Federation's flagship.

TC-14 is a protocol droid.  Her disabilites are a lack of weapon and a lack of 
jump.  She also cannot manipulate anything.  She will not be targeted by 
enemies, however.

It's worth noting that when protocol droids takes damage, they will continue 
to lose pieces of themselves.  This does not affect abilities, but it's 
kinda funny.

Abilities:
Protocol Access (B or Z at a Threepio panel, opens doors, etc.)

---

* Jar Jar Binks * - After I-2

A rather accident-prone Gungan, Jar Jar was recently banished from the city of 
Otoh Gunga following an accident due to his clumsiness.  Despite his 
character traits, he became a General in the Gungan Army, and later the 
ambassador of the Gungans to the Senate.

Jar Jar is a Gungan non-combatant.  He cannot attack, but he can still build 
and pull levers.  Also, he does have the ability to jump higher than most 
other characters.

Abilities:
High Double Jump (press A twice)

---

* Queen Amidala * - After I-3
* Padmé (Battle) * - After I-5
* Padmé (Geonosis) * - After II-3
* Padmé (Clawed) * - After II-4

Padmé Naberrie was raised among the nobles of Naboo, eventually becoming their 
elected queen at the age of fourteen and taking her name of state, Amidala.  
Once her term had ended, she stayed in the political spotlight as the 
representative of Naboo in the Senate.  It was then that she fell in love 
with the Jedi, Anakin Skywalker, and gave birth to twins, Luke and Leia, 
dying shortly thereafter.

These four are the same character with a costume change.  The first is the 
odd ornamental red dress of the Naboo Queen, then a simple red combat outfit, 
then her white outfit from the second movie, then her torn outfit after being 
attacked by the Nexu on Geonosis.

Padmé is an experienced gunner.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)
Dodge (press B at incoming fire)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)
Melee Attack (a series of face-slaps, followed by a hair flip)

---

* Captain Panaka * - After I-3

Panaka is the chief of security tasked specifically with protecting the 
Naboo royalty.  He accompanies her throughout the Naboo/Trade Federation 
incident, then stays behind to protect the new Queen Jamillia once Padmé's 
term expired.

Panaka is an experienced gunner.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)
Dodge (press B at incoming fire)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)
Melee Attack (a series of punches)

---

* R2-D2 * - After I-5 (or II-3, or III-2, or IV-1, or V-4, or VI-1)

Everyone's favorite astromech droid began (we imagine) his programming as a 
repair droid on a Naboo Star Cruiser.  He's been a surprisingly large number 
of places for a droid: Naboo, Tatooine, Coruscant, Geonosis, the Death Star, 
Yavin IV, Hoth, Dagobah, Bespin, Endor.  He's also the only droid to know 
EVERYTHING that went on in the Star Wars movies.  It's a shame he only speaks 
in bleeps/bloops.

Artoo is an astromech.  The disabilities of an astromech are a lack of 
weapon.  He also cannot manipulate anything.  However, Artoo will not 
generally be targeted by enemy fire.

Abilities:
Hover (hold down A, very little height, but long distance)
Zap (press B, disables most anything for a small time except for Jedi)
Astromech Access (Z at an Artoo panel, opens doors, etc.)

---

* Anakin Skywalker (Boy) * - After I-5

Born a slave on Tatooine, Anakin lived his young life in the service of 
Gardulla the Hutt, then later Watto the Toydarian.  Anakin was raised by his 
mother, and thus he is very attached to her.  At his mother's urging, he 
helps Qui-Gon and his companions fix their damaged ship and leaves with them 
for Coruscant, then later Naboo, where he is instrumental in the victory.

As a boy, Anakin is a non-combatant shortie.  He has no weapon, but can 
jump and manipulate things.

Abilities:
Crawl (press Z near a vent)

---

* R4-P17 * - After II-2

R4 is an astromech droid like most others.  She accompanied Obi-Wan on his 
mission to Kamino, and later Geonosis.  She also participated in the Battle 
of Coruscant, but did not survive.

R4 is an astromech.  The disabilities of an astromech are a lack of weapon.  
She also cannot manipulate anything.  However, she will not generally be 
targeted by enemy fire.

Abilities:
Hover (hold down A, very little height, but long distance)
Zap (press B, disables most anything for a small time except for Jedi)
Astromech Access (Z at an Artoo panel, opens doors, etc.)

---

* Anakin Skywalker (Padawan) * - After II-3
* Anakin Skywalker (Jedi) * - After III-2

Despite being too old for formal acceptance into the Jedi Temple, Anakin 
was trained to be a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi, where he excelled at using 
his powerful connection to the Force.  Soon after the outset of the Clone 
Wars, he was anointed as a Jedi Knight and became one of the Clone Wars' 
greatest heroes.

Anakin's two costumes are for his different looks between the two movies 
where he was an adult.  First his Padawan robes, then his darker Jedi robes 
from Episode III.

Grown-up Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi.

Abilities:
Lightsaber (main weapon)
Double Jump (press A twice)
Force (hold down Z while focused on an object with blue sparkles)
Mind Trick (press Z while focused on a non-droid enemy to stun them for a few 
 moments)
Force Push (hold down Z while focused on a droid)

---

* C-3PO * - After II-3 (or IV-1, or V-2, or VI-1)

This fussy protocol droid began his programming on Tatooine, in Anakin 
Skywalker's house.  He spent his early years helping with chores and farming, 
until collected by Anakin to travel to Geonosis.  He's suffered a memory 
wipe following the rise of the Empire, so remembers little before his tenure 
on the Tantive IV.

Threepio is a protocol droid.  His disabilites are a lack of weapon and a 
lack of jump.  He also cannot manipulate anything.  Like Artoo, though, he 
will not be targeted by enemies.

It's worth noting that when Threepio takes damage, he'll continue to lose 
pieces of himself.  This does not affect his abilities, but it's kinda 
funny.

Abilities:
Protocol Access (B or Z at a Threepio panel, opens doors, etc.)

---

* Mace Windu * - After II-4

One of the more prominent and talented members of the Jedi Council, Master 
Mace Windu has been touted as one of the finest lightsaber combatants in 
history.  He personally gathered a team of Jedi to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi 
from Geonosis.

Mace Windu is a Jedi.

Abilities:
Lightsaber (main weapon)
Double Jump (press A twice)
Force (hold down Z while focused on an object with blue sparkles)
Mind Trick (press Z while focused on a non-droid enemy to stun them for a few 
 moments)
Force Push (hold down Z while focused on a droid)

---

* Yoda * - After II-6 (or III-4, or V-4)

One of the most renowned Jedi Masters in the galaxy.  Yoda's species is 
still unknown.  A master of lightsaber combat and use of the Force, Yoda has 
seen much in his 900 years of life, but can he handle a headstrong farmboy, 
son of the Chosen One?

Yoda is an Old Jedi.  His normal walk is very slow.  When his saber is 
ignited, he gains speed.  Note that he does not have the "hover seat" that 
he had in LEGO Star Wars I.

Abilities:
Lightsaber (main weapon)
Double Jump (press A twice)
Force (hold down Z while focused on an object with blue sparkles)
Mind Trick (press Z while focused on a non-droid enemy to stun them for a few 
 moments)
Force Push (hold down Z while focused on a droid)

---

* Chancellor Palpatine * - After III-2

The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic is a position of moderator 
and diplomat.  During Palpatine's term, however, he began to exert far more 
control than his station warranted.  More power came to him, still, after he 
was granted emergency powers for the purpose of war.

Chancellor Palpatine is a non-combatant.  He can still build and pull levers, 
but he can't attack.

---

* Commander Cody * - After III-3

One of the millions of clones employed by the Republic to combat the Trade 
Federation, Cody is a command unit meant to lead.  He assists Obi-Wan Kenobi 
on Utapau after he chases General Grievous there, for a time, anyway.

Cody is a basic gunner.  Mockups of him (clones with shoulder pads) also 
appear as enemies in one mission, where they have two hearts.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)

---

* Chewbacca * - After III-4 (or IV-3, or V-2, or VI-1)

While he started his life in peace on Kashyyyk, war came to his planet, and 
he rose up along his Wookiee brothers to fight.  Following the war, he was 
captured into slavery.  He was then freed by Han Solo, who he then owed a 
life-debt to.  He stands as his partner's conscience and muscle.  He's also an 
exceedingly skilled mechanic, and a good friend.  Just don't make him mad.  

Chewbacca is an experienced gunner.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)
Dodge (press B at incoming fire)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)
Melee Attack (pulls the arms of his enemy if they can be beat in one hit, 
 otherwise punches)

---

* Princess Leia * - After IV-1
* Princess Leia (Hoth) * - After V-2
* Princess Leia (Bespin) * - After V-6
* Princess Leia (Boussh) * - After VI-1
* Princess Leia (Endor) * - After VI-3

Adopted in infancy by the Royal House of Alderaan, and given the name Leia 
Organa, this firebrand grew up in luxury, but became the Senator to Alderaan 
and a vital member of the Rebel Alliance.  When she was exposed as a member, 
she became one of the most popular beacons of hope for the Alliance, with 
her charm, charisma, and ferocity.

These five Leias are all the same character with a costume change.  The 
original being her white senatorial robe (or pantsuit), Hoth being a more 
bundled up affair, Bespin involves her with longer hair and a tan costume, 
and Endor in forest camo greens.  Boussh is her dressed up as an Ubesian 
bounty hunter in order to infiltrate Jabba's Palace.

Yes.  Read that again.  In LSW:CS, Leia (Boussh) is NOT a bounty hunter.  
She's just a gunner like everyone else.  She will only get bounty hunter 
abilities in Jabba's Palace with the hat.

Leia is an experienced gunner.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)
Dodge (press B at incoming fire)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)
Melee Attack (a series of face-slaps)

---

* Captain Antilles * - After IV-1
* Rebel Friend * - After IV-1

His first mission (when we saw him chronologically) was to give C-3PO a 
memory wipe.  Antilles is the captain of the Tantive IV (and no relation to 
Wedge Antilles).  He met his end about twenty years after that first mission 
at the hands (literally) of Darth Vader.  The Rebel Friend is just a red-
shirted (poor guy) version of Antilles.

The Rebels are basic gunners.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)

---

* Luke Skywalker (Tatooine) * - After IV-2
* Luke Skywalker (Stormtrooper) * - After IV-4
* Luke Skywalker (Pilot) * - After V-4

This farmboy from Tatooine grew up dreaming of flying the stars, and was 
always jealous when his friend Biggs would come home with stories of 
adventures.  He got his wish when he lost his adopted uncle and aunt to the 
Empire.

These three Lukes are the same character with a costume change.  The first 
is his simple desert outfit from Tatooine.  The second is a stolen suit of 
stormtrooper armor, and the third is his Rebel pilot jumpsuit.

Luke (pre-Jedi) is a master gunner.

Abilities:

All these characters must be bought from the bar.

* Gonk Droid * - Available at the beginning (3000)

The EG-6 Power Droid is an ungainly-looking machine.  Basically a box on two 
stubby legs, the Gonk is nonetheless an important part of starships, as it 
can create and store incredible amounts of power.

The Gonk Droid is a non-combatant.  Further, they have no abilities, cannot 
jump, and walk very slowly.

---

* PK Droid * - Available at the beginning (1500)

The PK series are simple worker droids.  They are very cheap models and can 
easily be bought in bulk.  The Trade Federation employed a large number of 
them for maintenance on their many ships.

The PK Droid is a non-combatant.  While faster than the Gonk Droid, they 
still cannot attack or jump, and have no abilities.  Like most non-combatant 
droids, though, most enemies will ignore them.

* Battle Droid * - After I-1 (6,500)
* Battle Droid (Security) * - After I-1 (8,500)
* Battle Droid (Commander) * - After I-1 (10,000)
* Battle Droid (Geonosis) * - After II-3 (8,500)

Battle droids are typical droids designed for combat, and heavily employed by 
the Trade Federation.  The simplest droids are the B1 series, which are 
capable of little more than attacking their enemies.  The more advanced 
predecessors, the OOM series, are programmed with more strategy and intellect, 
and are capable of more complex tasks such as security or command.

The four battle droid types are mostly the same.  The first is the standard 
droid from Episode I, the second is the type with red markings used for 
security, the third is the type with yellow markings used for command (they 
can take two hits as enemies), and the last is the more reddish type used on 
Geonosis.

Battle Droids are droid gunners.  They cannot jump or manipulate anything, 
but they can fight back.

* Droideka * - After I-1 (40,000)

One of the more feared sights in the Trade Federation army, Droidekas are 
fast, deadly, and resilient.  They travel by curling themselves up in a 
wheel, then unfold upon reaching their destination, where they will deploy 
personal shield generators and twin blaster cannons.  When fought as enemies, 
their shields take about six or so hits (or one down-stab with a saber), and 
their bodies take another three hits.

Droidekas are rather unique.  Like other droids, they cannot jump or 
interact with the environment, but they're formidable fighters, as their 
shields allow them to take several hits and their blasters are lethal.

Abilities:
Twin Blasters (main weapon)

---

* Captain Tarpals * - After I-2 (17,500)

Naboo among the rest of the Gungan Army.

a total wuss, bringing his spear and shield into battle.  However, he has 
nothing much to attack with besides a basic triple standing attack.

---

* Boss Nass * - After I-2 (15,000)

assassinations and other dirty work when his master wasn't free to move

doesn't make him that much different from other saber-users, apart from a

skilled and obedient, yet being able to reason on their own.

All Clones are the same, mostly with slight costume changes.  The first is 
the Clones as they appear in Episode II.  The next four are varied forms of

acrobatics.

Toggle".  Basically what it does is that you turn it on, then go into a 
mission on Free Play or Challenge.  As you cycle through the characters, 
you'll come across a few that aren't in the usual list.  I'll tell you right 
now that none of these characters are particularly special, but here they 
are, documented.

* Skeleton *

Available in: II-4, III-5, IV-2, IV-4, V-2, V-4, VI-2, VI-4, VI-5, Episode 
 IIi Character Bonus

Melee Attack (swinging its arm, then kicking out its leg)

---

* Buzz Droid *

Available in: III-1, III-2, III-3, Episode II Character Bonus

The Pistoeka sabotage droid is a small droid used for precise attacks.  They 
were generally deployed by a vulture droid's discord missile, where they 
would attach to starfighters and systematically pull them apart.

In III-1, the Buzz Droid is useless and does nothing.  In the others, the 
Buzz Droid is a droid melee fighter.  It has all the disadvantages of droids 
(no jump, no manipulating) only it has a melee attack.

Abilities:
Melee Attack (swinging its front arm)

---

* Training Remote *

Available in: III-5

The remote is a small spherical droid armed with a light blaster, generally 
used for training purposes, either by gunners or for lightsaber users.

The remote is a rather unique and mostly useless droid.  It floats, so it 
can't depress switches or the like and its light blaster does no damage.

Abilities:
Light blaster (main weapon, does no damage)

---

* Rebel Engineer *

Available in: IV-1, V-2, A New Hope

Like all good groups, even the Rebels have engineers to maintain their

identify.  Droid 3 is an Asp Droid, used for basic multifunctional work.  
Droid 4 is an R1, a precursor to the R2 series, used for navigation.

Despite their appearances, all the droids operate the same.  They're 
droid gunners.  They also move rather slowly.

Abilities:
Blaster (main weapon)

---

* Womp Rat *

Available in: IV-2, IV-3, VI-1, VI-4, Episode IV Character Bonus, LEGO City, 
 New Town

A womp rat is a larger than usual scavenging rodent.  Their native world 
is Tatooine.  They're known for their ferocity in packs and alarming 
reproduction rate.

Womp rats are non-combatants.  Their only use is the fact that they move 
quite fast and that they go unnoticed by enemies.

---

* Mouse Droid *

Available in: IV-4, IV-5, VI-5

The MSE-series of mouse droids were a series of service droids used to 
deliver messages and guide personnel in facilities where one could easily 
get lost.

Mouse Droids are non-combatants.  Their only use is the fact that they move 
quite fast and that they go unnoticed by enemies.

---

* Imperial Engineer *

Available in: IV-4, IV-5, VI-4, VI-5, Episode VI Character Bonus

On hand in most facilties, the Imperial Engineer is also known for his

Available in: V-5, V-6, VI-1, Episode V Character Bonus

As a test to see if Luke Skywalker could survive the freezing process, Han 
Solo was placed into a block of carbonite in the hopes that he could be 
contained.  He did survive, but after being removed, he had a small bout of 
hibernation sickness, which included temporary blindness.

Carbonite Han is a non-combatant.  All he can do is hop around and look 
silly.

---

* AT-AT Driver *

Available in: VI-3

Specially trained to pilot heavy vehicles, these troopers are still not 
much more than the average Imperial Grunt.

The AT-AT Driver is an Imperial Gunner.

Abilities: 
Blaster (main weapon)
Swan Dive (double press A to do a face plant on the floor)
Grapple (press Z on grapple points)
Imperial Access (press Z on white circles)

---

---

* Rancor *

Available in: Episode I Minikit Bonus

While their homeworld is Dathomir, rancors can be found in odd places 
throughout the galaxy, as they are incredibly ferocious and large predators.  
Jabba kept one in his palace to feed troublemakers to.

The Rancor is a non-combatant.  All it can do plod around incredibly 
slowly.  To its credit, though, it's invincible to enemy fire.

---

* Wampa *

Availble in : Episode V Minikit Bonus

A semisentient scavenging mammal, this white and hairy beast roams the 
wastes of Hoth for whatever it can scrounge.  It tends to live in caverns 
of ice to avoid harsh storms.

Like the Rancor, the Wampa is a non-combatant that plods around and is 
invincible.

12. SECRETS/UNLOCKABLES
******************************************************************************

Here's where I put all the stuff that's not a mission.  You'll find a quick 
list of basic unlocks, how all the Extras work, and a collection of codes 
you can enter to save yourself some studs.

===================
12A. Main Unlocks =
===================

For a mission:
Unlock Free Play by completing the mission.
Unlock the mission's minikit by collecting all ten minikits in it.
Get a gold brick by completing the Story.
Get a gold brick by earning True Jedi.
Get a gold brick by completing the minikit.
Unlock that mission's purchaseable extra by finding the Power Brick.

For outside the missions:
Unlock any Episode's Bonus Missions by completing all six missions.
Unlock the Bounty Hunter Challenges by purchasing Greedo, Bossk, Boba Fett, 
 Dengar, IG-88, and 4-LOM.

Find all 160 Gold Bricks and the Garage will have a large Gold Brick 
 structure to assemble.  Put it together and all Extras will automatically 
 be unlocked.  The structure will also spit out studs (but not nearly as 
 much as LSW2's Stud Fountain).

Earn 100% in the game by purchasing everything and finding every gold brick, 
 minikit, power brick, and by completing all Challenges.

IF you earn 100%, you can create characters with "Super Jedi Powers".  What

  - High double jump (on I-III, regular double jump on IV-VI)
  - Thermal detonators (press Z)
  - Sith Force (hold down Z, works on blue and red sparklies)
  - Random Force Powers (press Z when facing an enemy and you can perform 
   Mind Trick, Choke, or Lightning)
  - Ability to crawl through vents (press Z)
  - Ability to access ANY door panel (Artoo, Threepio, Imperial, Bounty 
   Hunter)
- Gunners will have:
  - Lando's melee attack (kicks and uppercut)
- Saber wielders will have:
  - Very fast saber combo
  - Force Grapple Leap

=============
12B. Extras =
=============

Extras are fun (or useful) little goodies you can apply to your game.  You 
can purchase them at the bar, then activate them in the Extras Menu.

Extras can be used in the cantina, in Story, in Free Play, or in the Character 
Bonus or Minikit Bonus missions.  They cannot be used in Super Story, LEGO 
City, or Bounty Hunter Challenges.  Furthermore, certain Extras cannot be 
used in Character Bonus or Minikit Bonus (which I explain in that section).

For the sake of having a quick list, I've also listed how to get each Power 
Brick, although you can also find this info in the Free Play section.

---

Normal Extras (can be purchased at any time)

Adaptive Difficulty (Available at beginning)
- With this off, you only lose 2,000 studs every time you die.  With this 
  on, things will be adjusted depending on how you play.  If you play well, 
  you'll lose 4,000 studs if you die.  If you play poorly and die a lot, 
  you'll only lose 1,000 studs.  Thanks to C.J. Morton for clearing this up.

Extra Toggle (30,000)
- Activate this and enter a mission on Free Play.  In addition to the 
  character you've picked and have been given, you'll also have a few extra 
  characters depending on the level.  See Section 11D for more info.

Fertilizer (8,000)
- Activate this, then hop on a bantha, dewback, or tauntaun, then press Z.  
  Yay, poop!

Disguise (10,000)
- Activate this and all characters will have a fake nose and glasses on.

Daisy Chains (5,000)
- Activate this to turn a grappler character's wire into a line of flowers.

Chewbacca w/ C3PO (10,000)
- Activate this and the Chewbacca character will have a mildly displaced 
  Threepio on his back, regardless of whether or not you're controlling him, 
  nor if Threepio is already there.

Tow Death Star (5,000)
- This will change all towable bombs into mini Death Stars.  The change is 
  purely cosmetic.

Silhouettes (10,000)
- This turns all characters into black silhouettes, although light will 
  still shine off them.

Beep Beep (7,500)
- With this on, press B in a vehicle that can't shoot, and it will beep 
  its horn.

---

Power Brick Extras (require finding the requisite Power Brick in a mission)

Super Gonk (100,000, Power Brick 1)
- This turns the slow, plodding Gonk Droid into a speed demon that can 
  jump.  That's about it, but it's kinda cute.
 Location: I-1 (Negotiations) - You need an Astromech and probably a High 
  Jumper for this.  In the second area, force the large canister on your left 
  so you can high jump up to the Artoo panel.  Use it, then go to the next 
  room.  Step on the gray space (not the button) and your buddy will step on 
  the button.  Double jump into each of the canisters on the left and right to 
  lower them.  Once both are down, have each of you step on the two new 
  buttons to reveal the brick.

Poo Money (100,000, Power Brick 2)
- When using this extra along with Fertilizer, pressing Z on a bantha, 
  dewback, or tauntaun will cause it to poop money!
 Location: I-2 (Invasion of Naboo) - You need a Bounty Hunter.  In the second 
  area, as you cross the sinking stones that you need Jar Jar for, you'll see 
  a green Bounty Hunter circle.  Use it to open a panel with this behind it.

Walkie Talkie Disable (5,000, Power Brick 3)
- If you use any character with a walkie talkie (Battle Droid (Commander) or 
  Imperial Spy), then using it will disable all droids in the area for a 
  short time.
 Location: I-3 (Escape From Naboo) - You need a Bounty Hunter and a Sith.  
  You need to solve the "puzzle" in the upper plaza in the first area.  One 
  block is already made for you.  Another needs to be assembled in the 
  canisters in the upper left.  The third needs a thermal detonator on the 
  shiny canisters in the back right.  The last needs a Sith to remove the 
  flowers with red sparklies, then blow up the planter they were in.  Once all 
  four blocks are assembled, they need to be pushed to their lit-up "ready" 
  spots, and they're all in the opposite corner they need to be in.  Once all 
  four are in place, Force them to their spots on the puzzle, and you're done.

Power Brick Detector (125,000, Power Brick 4)
- With this turned on, you'll have an arrow pointing at all the Power 
  Bricks.  This doesn't tell how to actually GET them, just where they are.
 Location: I-4 (Mos Espa Pod Race) - Just after all the rocks in the opening, 
  there's the drop off (not long before the service ramp).  After that drop 
  off, hold left to go around the holes.  It will be in your path.

Super Slap (5,000, Power Brick 5)
- This will double the damage of any non-saber melee attack.
 Location: I-5 (Retake Theed Palace) - In the dining area (with all the tables 
  and the shiny floor), go to the left side and Force together the chairs, 
  then the tables.  Smash the statue in the back and step on the button, then 
  Force out the plates and cups.  Now, blow up the whole mess to make this 
  appear.

Force Grapple Leap (15,000, Power Brick 6)
- This will basically turn any Jedi into a grappler.  Press Z on a grapple 
  point and they'll leap to its endpoint.
 Location: I-6 (Darth Maul) - You need an Imperial for this one.  At the exit 
  from the hangar, you'll find lifts on either side of the doorway.  Hop on 
  them and use the Force so the two characters will raise each other.  Use an 
  Imperial to get past the white circle at the top.  In the next room, step on 
  all ten of the black buttons on the floor, turning them red, which will make 
  the brick appear.  You do have to be quick.

Stud Magnet (100,000, Power Brick 7)
- You want this.  This increases your stud pickup radius considerably, 
  making collecting SO much quicker.
 Location: II-1 (Bounty Hunter Pursuit) - After the first force field area, 
  make a hard right.  To the left of the Imperial gate are several pylons with 
  green lights on top.  Shoot all of these before any of the lights shut back 
  off and a balloon will appear with the Power Brick on it.

Disarm Troopers (100,000, Power Brick 8)
- All enemy guns (except those on droids) will become delicious carrots, 
  which cannot shoot.
 Location: II-2 (Discovery on Kamino) - Use an Imperial on the left hand door 
  in the hallway outside Jango's room.  In this room, step on a light and wait 
  for your partner to step on the other.  Continue this pattern until all 
  lights are lit and the disco show begins.

Character Studs (100,000, Power Brick 9)
- With this active, defeating enemies will make them drop studs.  Not a lot, 
  but every little bit helps, right?
 Location: II-3 (Droid Factory) - In the fifth area (with all the Geonosians), 
  you'll find a gate made out of bricks you can smash down.  Do so, then enter 
  the doorway.  In this next room, you need to hit several Artoo panels to 
  move blast shields.  It's a pretty obvious pattern.  Hitting the fourth one 
  will allow you to get the Brick.

Perfect Deflect (25,000, Power Brick 10)
- This will allow you always deflect blaster bolts back at the shooter, as 
  long as you have the block active.  You don't need to press the attack 
  button just as the bolt hits you, anymore.
 Location: II-4 (Jedi Battle) - You need a Bounty Hunter.  To the right of 
  Anakin's post, use a thermal detonator on the shiny object to create bricks, 
  which you can use to build small steps to the Power Brick.

Exploding Blaster Bolts (20,000, Power Brick 11)
- With this on, your blaster will explode on contact.  This will splash to 
  anyone in the vicinity (yourself included).  It will also blow up shiny 
  things (that need thermal detonators) and when used in vehicle missions, 
  it will destroy things that normally need bombs or torpedos.
 Location: II-5 (Gunship Cavalry) - After you pass the first force field, 
  keep an eye on the right side of the screen.  The Power Brick is behind a 
  rock on the right side.

Force Pull (12,000, Power Brick 12)
- What this does, instead of pushing droids, you will pull them towards you 
  instead, where they will break on you.  This pretty much just means that 
  droids will always be broken instead of just possibly incapacitated.
 Location: II-6 (Count Dooku) - You need a Bounty Hunter and a Shortie for 
  this.  Near Dooku's standing spot is a shiny box.  Use a thermal detonator 
  on it and then Force the vent.  Crawl through with a Shortie, then grapple 
  up to the top of the structure to find this.

Vehicle Smart Bomb (15,000, Power Brick 13)
- I think I finally have this one figured out.  With this active, hold down 
  Z and any flying or walking enemies on screen will be destroyed.  This 
  works on any starfighters, AT-STs, probe droids, or anything else small 
  that moves around.  It DOESN'T work on gun emplacements or other things 
  you'd need to blow up to move ahead, like AT-ATs.
 Location: III-1 (Battle Over Coruscant) - Not long after you pass through a 
  cruiser's hangar, you'll see the brick spinning on the left side of the 
  screen.  Fly through it.

Super Astromech (10,000, Power Brick 14)
- If I'm told correctly, using this will allow your astromech's zaps to 
  bounce to multiple characters.
 Location: III-2 (Chancellor in Peril) - In the dropping elevator area, one of 
  the vents has a shiny covering.  Use a thermal detonator on it to remove its 
  cover and get this.  You'll probably find this easier to get to once you use 
  the Artoo panel to make the elevator go back up.

Super Jedi Slam (11,000, Power Brick 15)
- This will increase the area effect of the Jedi Slam (double jump, then 
  attack).  Makes cleanup of mobs rather easy and fun.  Also, this causes 
  unlimited damage to everyone but bosses.
 Location: III-3 (General Grievous) - In the hidden building on the far right, 
  use the Force on all four parts of the central structure to make this 
  appear.  You can't get this on Story.  You have to come back on Free Play 
  for it.

Super Thermal Detonator (25,000, Power Brick 16)
- This one about doubles the range of the thermal detonators, and it probably 
  increases their power, too, which was already pretty sizable to begin 
  with.
 Location: III-4 (Defense of Kashyyyk) - You need a Bounty Hunter and a Sith.  
  In the first area, at the first junction in the bridge path, take a right to 
  get to an object that you need to Sith Force.  Once you take away the outer 
  casing, use a thermal detonator on the inner part to blow it up.

Deflect Bolts (150,000, Power Brick 17)
- Who needs a saber, now?  With this active, all blaster bolts will bounce 
  off you, no matter what.
 Location: III-5 (Ruin of the Jedi) - You need a High Jumper for this.  In 
  the second to last room, after you activate the three levers on the right 
  side of the big archives room, high jump onto the platform that moved, then 
  move around the upper ledge to the left side of the room.  Hover behind the 
  closest force field as Artoo, then use the Threepio panel to lower the force 
  fields on the left-side alcoves.  Use the Force to pull out platforms, then 
  high jump up to all the levers (one needs a button to lower a force field).  
  Once all three levers are pulled, a platform moves to the upper left ledge.  
  Climb back up there and high jump up to the brick.

Dark Side (25,000, Power Brick 18)
- Give in to your anger.  Actually, all this does is give any Jedi the 
  ability to manipulate objects with red sparklies.  You have a red saber to 
  play with, too.
 Location: III-6 (Darth Vader) - On the left side of the second room, use the 
  Artoo panel to open the door to the brick.

Super Blasters (15,000, Power Brick 19)
- This will double the damage of all blasters.  This includes Fett's blaster, 
  which already does double damage anyway.  Unfortunately, bosses will still 
  only take one heart of damage per hit.
 Location: IV-1 (Secret Plans) - You need a Bounty Hunter or an Imperial.  
  After chasing off Darth Vader, you'll find a hallway with a green circle 
  nearby, and a white circle further down the hall.  Use either with their 
  respective character and head into a secret hallway.  Use the Threepio 
  panel here, and continue ahead through the door to reach a shower area.  
  Force the nearest one on the right to create plants, which can be destroyed 
  to find the brick.

Fast Force (40,000, Power Brick 20)
- This basically makes using the Force on objects go much faster.  Useful if 
  impatient or you're surrounded by bad guys.
 Location: IV-2 (Through the Jundland Wastes) - You need a Bounty Hunter.  
  Just after the bantha area, on the right are two shiny structures past a big 
  hole.  Hover over there and use TDs to blow them away.  This is the Tusken 
  Village.  Near you on the right are three boxes.  Make a tower out of them 
  and hop up to the rock.  Hover over to the far rock and push the mine cart 
  down the slope so it rolls into the wall, breaks it, and uncovers the 
  brick.  If you have trouble getting over there with the structures intact, 
  or have a hard time throwing TDs, you can also use the Droid Self-Destruct, 
  which gives the same kind of explosion.

Super Lightsabers (40,000, Power Brick 21)
- This makes your lightsaber purple and doubles its damage.  Sadly, you will 
  still only take one heart off bosses.
 Location: IV-3 (Mos Eisley Spaceport) - To the left of the door out of the 
  first area are four garbage cans.  Use the Force on all four to remove their 
  lids, then again to remove all the parts inside.  Once all the parts are 
  out, assemble the door.

Tractor Beam (15,000, Power Brick 22)
- This is for vehicle missions.  Enemies that get too close to you will get 
  sucked up behind you and will not be able to fire straight, giving you a 
  clear shot at them.
 Location: IV-4 (Rescue the Princess) - As you progress past the first control 
  room, you'll come upon an Artoo panel on your left.  Enter the room, hover 
  over to the left side, then grapple up.

Invincibility (1,000,000, Power Brick 23)
- As it says, you will not be docked hearts if hit by an enemy.  However, 
  you will still react and be interrupted if you're Forcing something or 
  building something.
 Location: IV-5 (Death Star Escape) - After exiting the compactor, use the 
  Threepio panel to access another compactor.  Put together the fridge and use 
  the Force to open it up.

Score X2 (1,250,000, Power Brick 24)
- Very useful, and very expensive.  As implied, silver studs will be worth 
  20, gold studs 200, and blue studs 2000.  This will allow you to get True 
  Jedi much more quickly in missions.  The REALLY cool part about the score 
  multipliers is that they stack, meaning that if you bought all of them, 
  you'd be getting Score X 3840, which is just ridiculous.
 Location: IV-6 (Rebel Attack) - At the end of the trench, on the back right 
  side of the exhaust port's enclosure, is a small tucked away corner which 
  has the brick.

Self Destruct (25,000, Power Brick 25)
- If you're a droid, press B with this active and you'll blow up.  Simple, 
  and you won't lose studs.  You can actually use this within a group of 
  enemies to take them out, and it acts as a Thermal Detonator, blowing up 
  shiny objects.
 Location: V-1 (Hoth Battle) - You need a TIE for this.  Behind the second TIE 
  Gate, and through the tunnel, this is behind a wall at the end.  You need to 
  drag a bomb from the beginning of the tunnel all the way through, avoid the 
  AT-AT, and hit the wall with it.

Fast Build (30,000, Power Brick 26)
- This seriously shortens your build time.  Useful if you're impatient, or 
  if the bad guys keep interrupting you.
 Location: V-2 (Escape From Echo Base) - You need a Sith for this.  In the 
  area just before the hangar, use Sith Force on the wall ornaments on the 
  slope to create steps.  Climb up them carefully using double jumps, then 
  go to the right and open the Artoo panel.  In this room, pull the lever on 
  the "slot machine" that has red and white circles.  Once you get the 
  circles, a door in the hangar will open that has this.

Score X4 (2,500,000, Power Brick 27)
- Score multiplies by 4.  See Score X2 for more info.
 Location: V-3 (Falcon Flight) - In the first area, this one is behind the 
  back right Star Destroyer as you look at it.  Just fly around behind the 
  bridge tower and you should pick it up eventually.

Regenerate Hearts (150,000 Power Brick 28)
- Every few seconds, you'll gain a heart back if you've lost some.  Good for 
  staying alive, and quite a bit cheaper than invincibility or a Ghost.
 Location: V-4 (Dagobah) - You need a Sith.  In the first area, use Sith Force 
  on the black plants, then jump across the gap.  Walk to the race track and 
  bust the box to find a tractor to assemble.  Roll the tractor over all the 
  red lights to make them green.  Do it quickly.

Minikit Detector (250,000, Power Brick 29)
- You'll see a big flashing arrow pointing to hidden minikits.  Of course, 
  since I tell you where to find them all in this guide, you won't find many 
  uses, will you?
 Location: V-6 (Betrayal Over Bespin) - On Free Play, the Slave I actually 
  stays.  Hop on top of it to find the brick.
 NOTE: Despite being #29, this one is found in V-6.

Score X6 (5,000,000, Power Brick 30)
- Score multiplies by 6.  See Score X2 for more info.
 Location: V-5 (Cloud City Trap) - You need a Bounty Hunter.  In the first 
  area, float to the back of the room, then use a TD on the bars to open the 
  way to the brick.
 NOTE: Despite being #30, this one is found in V-5.

Super Zapper (14,000, Power Brick 31)
- This actually makes Jawas and Ugnaughts (somewhat) useful.  With this 
  turned on, their zapper weapons will actually cause damage.
 Location: VI-1 (Jabba's Palace) - In the room you find Luke, up in the area 
  on the right.  Either double jump off the box up there, or push the box onto 
  the button, which holds a grapple point visible.

Bounty Hunter Rockets (20,000, Power Brick 32)
- This is fun.  Press Y while either Jango Fett or Boba Fett and you'll 
  launch a rocket, which will home in on enemies.
 Location: VI-2 (The Great Pit of Carkoon) - Near the last deck on the top of 
  the barge, bust open a box and assemble a grapple point.  Grapple up to the 
  platforms above, then hover over twice to the brick.

Score X8 (10,000,000, Power Brick 33)
- Score multiplies by 8.  See Score X2 for more info.
 Location: VI-3 (Speeder Showdown) - You need a Shortie for this.  At the 
  landing platform, push the box into the left support pylon, then crawl into 
  it.

Super Ewok Catapult (25,000, Power Brick 34)
- I bet you think this does something to those big catapults in the forest, 
  right?  Nope!  What this does is turn an Ewok's slingshot (also known as a 
  "catapult" in some dialects) into a torpedo launching weapon!  BOOM!
 Location: VI-4 (The Battle of Endor) - You need an Imperial and a Sith.  
  Inside the bunker, go left to the purple lever room.  Use the Sith Force on 
  the panel on the floor, use the white circle, then bust down the blockage on 
  the right.  Push the box into the hole, go up on the catwalk above by 
  hovering from the other side of the room.  Use the Threepio panel, then 
  crawl through the vent.  Push the box to the back of the room, then the 
  brick will appear.

Infinite Torpeodes (25,000, Power Brick 35)
- In vehicle missions, generates torpedoes behind your craft (if they can 
  carry them) for quick use.  Makes Minikit Bonuses a lot easier.
 Location: VI-6 (Into the Death Star) - This is in the core, on the left side.  
  Get two torpedoes and torp each side of the enclosure to release it.
 NOTE: Despite being #35, this one is found in VI-6.

Score X10 (20,000,000, Power Brick 36)
- Score multiplies by 10.  See Score X2 for more info.
 Location: VI-5 (Jedi Destiny) - Sith Force the eight red lights flanking the 
  Emperor's throne.  Do it quickly and the brick will appear above the throne.
 NOTE: Despite being #36, this one is found in VI-5.

13. TWO PLAYER ARCADE
******************************************************************************

Naturally, you need a second player in order to access this.  This basically 
puts you and another player in a specially designed arena.  You will compete 
for points.  You earn these points by ways of parameters you set at the 
outset:

Level: Select any of the twelve arenas.  I will describe these further below.
Mode: Duel - You earn a point every time you strike down your opponent.
      Battle Enemies - Standard enemies will be dropped into the fray and 
       you have to destroy 10, 25, or 50 to get a point.
      Collect Studs - You earn a point every time your stud total reaches 
       50,000, 100,000, or 250,000.
Target: If Off, then you'll play until you decide to stop.  If set to 5, 10, 
 25, or 50 points, then the game will end when you reach that number, and the 
 winner will be credited with the match.
Reset Scores: Select and the match score will be reset to zero all.

Once you select your parameters, you'll select your characters.  You can 
each pick one, and then the game will give you a standard Free Play set.  
You'll both be able to switch through all available characters.  After that, 
the game will begin.

The winner of the match is determined by what your Target is set to.  Every 
time a player completes the role of the "Mode" (striking down the opponent, 
beating the requisite number of enemies, or finding enough studs), the 
player gets a point.  If you've set the Target to be a number, the game 
will stop and the winner will be given a match point.

---

Levels -

Senate: A large circular arena based around the Senate chamber on Coruscant.  
 There are three major levels and grapple points connecting them.

Utapau: This is a semi-circular area based on the fight with Grievous.  
 There are platforms that extend towards the center, as well as a high 
 ledge that can be grappled up to.

Hoth: The ice planet's arena is a trench-laden affair.  Tight passageways 
 make for close combat, and watch for grapple points to get to higher 
 ledges.

Dagobah: This swampy mud-hole is roughly based off the training area on 
 Dagobah.  A series of islands separated by deadly water makes for a rather 
 flat arena.

Kamino: This open area is circular platforms and back ledges, connected by 
 grapple points and gaps that you would need to hover over to get to.

Kashyyyk: The woods of Kashyyyk are largely just platforms connected by 
 bridges.  It's not a big area, but look out for some spots where you 
 can grapple or Force to get to some cool back areass.

Theed Palace: This is the Character Bonus for Episode I.  One main low path 
 plus a bunch of high ledges along the sides.

Geonosis: This is the Episode II Character Bonus in the Droid Factory, 
 complete with moving buckets and square platforms, plus buttons that connect 
 bridges.

Mustafar: The Episode III Character Bonus is a squarish area with small 
 rocky platforms and lots of lava for quick instant kills.

Mos Eisley: The Episode IV Character Bonus is an area of lots of walls and 
 confined passages.

Bespin: The Episode V Character Bonus is an open area of platforms and 
 connecting bridges which need to be extended with buttons.

Endor: The Ewok village is the Episode VI Character Bonus, situated with 
 large platforms, huts to hide in, and a few hidden areas.

This FAQ was made 100% by me, and is Copyright © 2008 Scott "CyricZ" 
Zdankiewicz.  You may not take it in whole or in part and claim it as your 
own.  You may not alter it in any way, even if you ask me first, and that 
includes putting it in HTML format.  Please don’t post this on your site 
unless you have express consent by me.  I’ve put a lot of time into this.  
Give me some credit.

Currently, the following sites have permission to post my FAQ:

www.gamefaqs.com
www.gamewinners.com
www.ign.com
www.cheatcc.com
www.cheatplanet.com
www.neoseeker.com

I'm not going to allow people with small personal sites to post this FAQ.  
They may post the link on GameFAQs with all the LEGO Star Wars TCS guides, but, 
trying to keep updates, well, updated, I'll only allow large committed sites 
that I trust.

========================
14B. E-mail Guidelines =
========================

If you wish to e-mail me, be sure to follow these guidelines...

- Make ABSOLUTELY sure I haven't already answered your question in the guide.
- Make sure it has something to do with LEGO Star Wars TCS.  I don't want spam, 
chain letters, offers for friendship.  Compliment me on the FAQ all you want, 
though.
- Make sure you say LEGO Star Wars at one point in your e-mail.  I have more 
than one Star Wars FAQ, and asking a generic question such as "How do I beat 
the last level?" doesn't tell me much.
- Spell correctly and use proper grammar, please.  If I can't understand 
your e-mail, it'll go to the junk pile.

==============
14C. Credits =
==============

CJayC, SBAllen, and all respective webmasters for having this on their sites.

CJ Morton for explaining adaptive difficulty.

mr_rex for his list of Extra Toggle characters.

Several people for pointing out what Walkie Talkie Disable and Super 
Astromech do.

Lucasarts Entertainment Company and Traveller's Tales, for this fine example 
of a Star Wars game.

LEGO, for their world of imagination.

George Lucas, for his world of imagination.

======================
14D. Version Updates =
======================

Version 1.0 - 1/2/2008 - Oops.  Didn't fill this in the first time. >_>
 Um, so yeah.  Retroactively, this had everything except Two Player Arcade, 
 really, but...

Version 1.1 - 1/12/2008 - Filled in lots of gaps.  Added walkthroughs to 
 LEGO City and New Town.  Two Player Arcade is complete.  This guide should 
 be pretty much done.

Version 1.2 - 3/1/2008 - A few corrections, minor additions.  Thanks to 
 everyone for your help!

=====================
14E. The Final Word =
=====================

Ah, good.  They gave us the whole experience in one game, caught up the 
original game, and gave us enough new stuff so that it's (more or less) a 
justifiable purchase.

Take care and may the farce be with you!  (No, that's not a spelling error.  
Look up the word.)
