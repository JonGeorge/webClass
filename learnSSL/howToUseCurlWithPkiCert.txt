How to Use Curl with PKI Cert
-----------------------------

Assumptions
 A) You have a PKI client cert
 B) You want to use it with curl
 C) You have CYGWIN installed (to use the curl command
 
Procedures
----------
 1. Download and install OpenSSL 1.0.1p with development files
    a. Go to http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html
    b. Select "Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.1p" (next to Works with MSVC++, Builder 3/4/5, and MinGW. Comes in form of self-install executables. )
       NOTE:  It should take you here:  http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
    c. Select Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.1p
       NOTE:  It should take you here:  http://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_0_1p.exe         
    d. Save Win64OpenSSL-1_0_1p.exe to your c:\vault
       a) Run c:\vault\Win64OpenSSL-1_0_1p.exe
          1) In the "Welcome to the openSSL (64-bit) setup wizard" screen, press Next
          2) In the License Agreement screen, select "I accept" and press "Next"
          3) In the "Select destination location" screen
             Set the destination to c:\tools\openssl-1.0.1p
             Press Next
          4) In the "Select Start Menu Folder" screen, use the defaults and press Next
          5) In the "Select Additional Tasks", choose "The Openssl binaries /bin directory" and press Next
          6) In the "Ready to Install" screen, press Install
 
    e. Add C:\tools\openssl-1.0.1p\bin to your PATH
    
    f. Verify that openssl is in your path
       DOS> openssl version
       OpenSSL 1.0.1p 9 Jul 2015 
 
 
 2. Convert your .p12 file format to a .pem
    a. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
    b. In the DOS window, type-in this:
       CMD> openssl pkcs12 -in c:\temp\myClientCert.p12 -out c:\temp\myClientCert.pem -nodes
             
            NOTE:  the -nodes option removes the password
            

3. Get the RSA private key from your .pem signed cert
   CMD> openssl rsa -in c:\temp\myClientCert.pem -out c:\temp\myClientCertKey.pem
        -- Generates this file:  myClientCertKey.pem
        
        
4. Use curl with the signed cert (in pem format) and RSA private key (in pem format)
   CYGWIN> cd /cygdrive/c/temp
   CYGWIN> curl --key myClientCertKey.pem  --cert myClientCert.pem 'https://myWebServer.com/whatever' --insecure
