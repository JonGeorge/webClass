Lesson:  Create an Architect-to-role Diagram
--------------------------------------------

Procedure
---------
 1. Get a high-level architecture diagram
 2. For each component in the diargram
      Add a note:  If a change is made, 
                     I need to be notified (but no approval)
                     I need to grant approval
                     

For example:
  Data Feed #1:  Who is responsible?
                 Who is allowed to make changes?
                 Who is notified when a change is made?
