Lesson:  Upon arrival onto a new project with existing data feeds, evaluate the existing data strategy.
Lesson:  Do not accept the status quo.  Change it.


If the existing data strategy is flawed or grossly inefficient -- e.g., the tables in Accumulo are not setup well for running analytics
Then
  As the new team leader, you can say *up front*
    1) This data strategy is flawed
    2) We should re-organize the data in a different way
    
If you wait until months later, the honeymoon will end and you will not be able to make such changes.

But, if you are up-front about your concerns, then you are taking the first steps to changing the status quo.
