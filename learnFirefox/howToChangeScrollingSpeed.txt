there is a quick and easy way for you to change the scrolling speed and override the system settings.


Procedure
---------
 1. Startup firefox
 
 2. Go to the firefox settings by clicking
    about:config
     
 3. Click "I accept the risk"
 
 4. Change mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount to 10

          mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount
  
    b. Double-click on 
          mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount
     
    c. Enter a value of 10
    
    

5. Change the acceleration speed 
   mousewheel.acceleration.start is the number of times the wheel is scrolled before the acceleration kicks in
  
   a. In the "about:config" search box, type-in this:
        mousewheel.acceleration
        
   b. Double-click on  
        mmousewheel.acceleration.start

   d. Open a new firefox tab to see the difference
   
 
   
6. Change the acceleration factor
   mousewheel.acceleration.factor = 10 means your scrolling speed will increase by 10 times when the acceleration starts
