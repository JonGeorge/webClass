How to Solve the "NoSuchMethod" error appeared while running a test
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My Spring Test context would not startup because it could not instantiate a postgres datasource
The postgres datasource would not instantiate because it could not startup the c3p0 connection pool

According to my pom.xml, I should be using c3p0 connection pool 0.9.5.2
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mchange</groupId>
            <artifactId>c3p0</artifactId>
            <version>0.9.5.2</version>
        </dependency>

But, intelij was using c3p0 0.9.1.1
 -- Press F4 (to go to Project Structure)
 -- Click on the Libraries item [on the left]
 -- It was showing com.mchange:c3p0:0.9.1.1
   
SOLUTION:  Delete the com.mchange:c3p0:0.9.1.1 in the Project Settings / Libraries
           And retry the test class
           And, then it worked
