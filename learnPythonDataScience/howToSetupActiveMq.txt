How to Setup Apache ActiveMQ
----------------------------
Key Points:
  A) AMQP is an open internet protocol for reliably sending and receiving messages. 
     It makes it possible for everyone to build a diverse, coherent messaging ecosystem.
     AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
     
  B) Apache ActiveMQ can be configured to use the AMQP protocol
  
  C) Qpid Proton is a high-performance, lightweight messaging library. 
     It can be used in the widest range of messaging applications, including brokers, client libraries, routers, bridges, proxies, and more. Proton makes it trivial to integrate with the AMQP 1.0 ecosystem from any platform, environment, or language. More about Qpid Proton.
