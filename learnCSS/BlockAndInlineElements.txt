Block vs. Inline CSS elements
-----------------------------



Block-level CSS Elements
------------------------
Block-level elements have a few properties:
 1) They start new lines of text when you use them
 2) They can contain other blocks *and* inline elements
 3) Several values of the 'display' property make an element block-level.
 
The horizontal position and size of a non-floating, block-level element is determined by seven properties:
    margin-left
    border-left
    padding-left
    width
    padding-right
    border-right
    margin-right

The sum of these seven properties is always equal to the 'width' of the parent element.

Most frequently used block-level CSS elements
---------------------------------------------
  <div>
  <p>
  <form>
  <h1>
  <h2>
  <h3>
  <ol>
  <ul>
  <table>
  <pre>






Inline-level CSS Elements
-------------------------
Inline-level elements have a few properties:
 1) An inline element define text or data in the document like STRONG makes the enclosed text strongly emphasized and Q says the enclosed text is a quotation.
 2) They don't start new lines when you use them
 3) They generally only contain other lineine tags *or* they include nothing at all, like the BR tag.
 4) They do not have a WIDTH property.  An inline-level width is defined by the container block
    In fact, all of these properties will be *ignored* on an inline-level elements
    width 
    height
    max-width 
    max-height
    min-width 
    min-height
    


With CSS you can change the type of an element from inline to block or the reverse with just one CSS property:
  display: block;
  display:inline;
  display:none;
