Lesson:  I upgraded my router and file sharing stopped working
--------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: I upgraded my Verizion Fios router and lost my file sharing. 
 
What Happaned
-------------
You may have changed from home or work network to a public network
 -- The public network probably has file sharing turned off
 -- The home (private) network has file sharing turned on
 -- When you upgraded your router, you moved from a home network to a public network
          
          
Solution
--------
 1. Login to the computer that has the files to be shared
 2. Go to Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center
    -- Set your home network as a "home network"  [not a public one]
 3. Go to Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Firewall\Allowed Programs
    -- Check   "File and Printer Sharing" for your Home/Work
    -- Uncheck "File and Printer Sharing" for Public
    
 4. For the laptops on your network, do the same
    -- Once done, my wireless laptop could ping my desktop *and*
    -- Once done, my wireless laptop could map network drives on my desktop
