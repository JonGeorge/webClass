Procedure
---------
 1. Download the Clonezilla USB Live ISO
    a. Go to http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable
       1) CPU architecture:  Select "amd64" (for Intel chips)
       b) File Type:         Select "iso"
       c) Repository:        Select "auto"

    b. Press "Download"
    c. Save clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso to your ~/Downloads directory

    
 2. Write the Clonezilla USB Live ISO to your USB Flashdrive
    a. Connect your flashdrive to your computer

    b. Run fdisk to identify the device id
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> fdisk -l

       In my case, I see my 32 GB flash drive as /dev/sdg
            Disk /dev/sdg: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
            Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
            Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            Disk label type: dos
            Disk identifier: 0x31f1464f

    c. Setup the FAT32 filesystem on your USB flashdrive
       unix> umount /dev/sdg1 
             *or*
             umount /dev/sdg
       unix> mkfs.vfat /dev/sdg -I -v

    d. Use dd to write the clonezilla ISO file to your USB flashdrive device
       unix> cd ~/Downloads
       unix> dd if=clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso  of=/dev/sdg status=progress bs=8MB && sync
