Notes when Tricia cooked this recipe:
 1) Use 85% beef
 2) She skipped the beef stock [because she didn't have any]
 3) She added a large thyme leaf (fresh)
 4) Use a cast-iron skillet
 
We all loved this recipe!  The burgers cook in the onions/thyme mixture [so the juice does not drip away as it would on a grill]
