Feedback on Making Burgers
--------------------------

I tried making burgers on the grill -- but some of them were still not fully cooked
 a. I followed the steps and made hamburger patties with lots of salt and pepper
 b. I had them on the grill (placed on the left side) with only the left 2 grills running
    -- Grilled for well over 15 minutes
    -- The smaller ones were getting overcookied
    -- The bigger ones were undercooked


Things to do differently
------------------------
 a. Make the patties *consistent* in size  (you don't want to have to pull some off early)
 b. Make the patties smaller and flatter
 c. Ask for how many should have cheese before you pull them off the grill
