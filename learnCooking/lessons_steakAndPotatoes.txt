Lessons from making Steak & Potatoes on 08/19/2018

Ingredients
 1) 1" Porterhouse Steak
 2) Bunch of carrots
 3) 2 Russet potatoes, cut into fries
 4) 1 big sweet potato, cut into fries
 
I seasoned the potatoes and carrots with olive oil, sat, and pepper in a plastic bag -- that worked well
 
End resuls
 A) Steak was underseasoned
 B) Russet potatoes were stuck to the pan
 C) carrots were not stuck to the pan -- but were oily
 D) Sweet potatoe fries were burnt
 
Lessons for next time:
 + Cut the potatoes into bigger pieces.  The carrots were bigger and did not get burnt
 + Reduce the temp?  The temp was 425 -- it may have been too hot
 + When seasoning steak, go heavy
 + When seasoning thick steak, go extra heavy
