How to Cook Steak
-----------------


05/16/2020: Bought Australian grass-fed Ribeye Steak (without bone)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Preperation:  Added Montreal Steak Seasoning to one steak   [1st ingredient is salt]
              Added Grill seasoning to other steak          [2nd ingredient is salt]
              Seasoned for 15 minutes

Cook:  High heat for 10 minutes (flipped in the middle)
       Med heat for   2 minutes
       Med heat for   1 minute (for thicker steak)

Result:
 A) Steaks were chewy
 B) Steaks were too raw
 C) The montreal steak seasoning was too overwhelming -- too much salt
 D) The Grill seasonsing was underwhelming -- needed more salt

Lessons:
 1) Don't trust the temp guage:  cut it open and look
 2) If you use Montreal Steak seasoning, go lighter
 3) Look at the steak seasoning:  if salt is the first ingredient, then perhaps don't use as much
