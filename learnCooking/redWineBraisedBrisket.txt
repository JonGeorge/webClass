------------------------------------


Ingredients
-----------
1  3-5-pound beef brisket
3  tablespoons smoked spanish paprika
5  teaspoons kosher salt 
2  teaspoons ground black pepper
2  tablespoons dried oregano
2  medium yellow onions, peeled and quartered
10 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed slightly
1  6-ounce can tomato paste
5  (up to) cups dry red wine Water or broth, as needed
   NOTE:  You may need only *ONE* bottle wine
          It depends on the size of your cooking pan and the quantity of beef

Directions
----------
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

 2. Mix smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and oregano. 

 3. Place brisket in a roasting pan and rub on all sides with spice mixture. 
    Turn so brisket is fat-side up, and scatter quartered onions and garlic cloves around the sides.

 4. Whisk together wine and tomato paste, and pour in around brisket. 
    Add enough water or broth to the pan so that the liquid comes 3/4 up the side of the meat.
    Cover pan tightly with foil and braise in oven about 5-6 hours, or until meat is tender.

 5. Scrape off and discard the fat. 
    Use a fork to mash in garlic cloves and shred the brisket. 
    Stir meat into the pan sauce. 
    Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper, as desired.
