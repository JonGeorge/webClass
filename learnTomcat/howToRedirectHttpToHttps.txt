How to Redirect HTTP Traffic to HTTPS in Tomcat
-----------------------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You have a Tomcat setup
 

Procedure
---------
 1. Make sure you have an HTTPS connector in your <TOMCAT-HOME>/conf/server.xml
 
 2. Make sure you have an HTTP connector in your <TOMCAT-HOME>/conf/server.xml
    NOTE:  If your HTTPS connector is listening on 8443
           Then, make sure the HTTP connector has redirectPort=8443
           

 3. Adjust your web.xml so that the transport-gaurantee is set to CONFIDENTIAL
    
    <security-constraint>
       <web-resource-collection>
          <web-resource-name>Protected Area</web-resource-name>
          <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
       </web-resource-collection>

       <user-data-constraint>
         <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
       </user-data-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
