       Filesystem                       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
       /dev/mapper/vg_centosvm-lv_root   35G  3.7G   30G  12% /
       tmpfs                            1.9G   84K  1.9G   1% /dev/shm
       /dev/sda1                        477M   64M  388M  15% /boot
       vault                            908G  773G  135G  86% /media/sf_vault  
       
       NOTE:  You should see the line with vault in it
       
       
    g. Allow your regular users to use your shared folder
       Copy the "vault" entry from /etc/mtab to /etc/fstab
       unix> grep vault /etc/mtab
             vault /media/sf_vault vboxsf gid=493,rw 0 0
