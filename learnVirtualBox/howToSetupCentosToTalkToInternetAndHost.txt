How to Setup the CentOS VM to Talk to the Internet and your Host
----------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose your centOS VM is running lots of daemons and app servers.
Suppose you want to use the web browser from your Windows 7 host to talk to the centOS VM


Procedure
---------
 1. Shutdown your CentOS VM
 
 2. Open the VirtualBox Manager
    a. Right-click on your CentosVM -> Settings 
    b. Click on the "Network" tab
    c. Change Adapter 1 from NAT to "Bridged Adapter"
       Press OK
       
 3. Get IP information from your Windows host
    a. Open a CMD prompt by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
       CMD> ipconfig /all
       
            Get the IP address, default gateway, DNS from your ethernet card
            -- e.g., 10.3.0.21, 10.3.0.1, 10.2.0.30
            
 4. Assign it a static IP address that would be near it -- e.g., 10.3.0.55
    a. Startup your CentOS VM
    b. Open a Terminal
       unix> nm-connection-editor
       
       1) Single click on System eth0 and press "Edit"
       2) Click on the "IPv4 Settings" tab
          Method:  Manual
          
          Press the "Add" button
          Address=10.3.0.55        [I used a number that I hope is safe]
          Netmask=255.255.255.0
          Gateway=10.3.0.1         [same gateway as windows host]
          DNS servers=30.2.0.30    [same DNS as windows primary DNS]
          
          Check "Connect automatically"
       
       3) Restart the network service
          unix> sudo service network restart

 5. Turn off the iptables service  [so that all ports are open]
    unix> sudo service iptables stop

 6. Make sure the iptables service is not turned-on during restart
    unix> sudo chkconfig iptables off

 7. Verify it works
    a. Create a bogus.html file
       unix> vi /var/www/html/bogus.html
    
       <html>
        <body>
         <h1>bogus.html</h1>
       </body>
      </html>

   b. Turn on the httpd daemon
      unix> sudo httpd -k start
      
   c. Open a web browser *in your centOS vm*
      Go to http://10.3.0.55/bogus.html
      
   d. Open a web browser *in your host Windows box*
      Go to http://10.3.0.55/bogus.html
      
   e. Turn off the httpd daemon
      unix> sudo httpd -k stop
