How to Tell Eclipse to use a Specific Java JDK
----------------------------------------------

Problem:  You have multiple Java JDKs on your box
          You want Eclipse to use a specific one.
          

Solution: Modify the eclipse.ini 



Assumpions:
 A) You have Eclipse installed on your Windows Box in this directory
      C:\tools\eclipse\
      
 B) You have a Java JDK 7 installed here:
      C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_60
      
 C) You have a Java JDK 8 installed here:
      C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91
      
      
Procedure
---------
 1. If Eclipse is running, then shut it down
 
 
 2. Make a copy of your eclipse.ini file
    DOS> cd c:\tools\eclipse
    DOS> copy eclipse.ini eclipse.ini.ORIG
    
    
 3. Edit the eclipse.ini file
    
    NOTES: 
      1) Add this to the *top* of the file:
      2) make sure there are no leading spaces:
      3) Make sure there are no quotes on this line
      4) If the path contains "jre" (e.g. as in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\client\jvm.dll) it is a JRE
         If the path contains "jdk" (e.g. as in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_31\bin\javaw.exe) it is a JDK.

      
    -vm
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_60\bin\javaw.exe

    
 4. Startup Eclipse
