Where is the Eclipse Log File?
------------------------------
If you are having problems with Eclipse, looking at its log file is a good idea:

Two places it is often located:
   1) (eclipse_home_directory) / workspace / .metadata/ .log
   
   2) (eclipse_home_directory) / configuration / *.log
   
   

To see the log file in Windows
------------------------------
 1) Open a window, type-in this:
    tail -f c:\tools\eclipse\workspace\.metadata\.log
    
 2) Startup Eclipse
