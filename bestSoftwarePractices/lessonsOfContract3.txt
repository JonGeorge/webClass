Lessons of Contract 3
---------------------
I was only one this contract for a short period (2 months in 2016).

But, there are lessons in this one:

 1. Before you join a project, make sure the project has real customers
    - This project built something without having requirements or customers in the hope
      of productizing it
      
 2. Be wary of clients who use lots of buzzwords
    - The client would use references to "own this space" a lot and it never made sense to me
    
 3. Be ware of clients who hold lots of meetings 
    - The client would love to have meetings face-to-face and conf calls
    - Most of the meetings were about listening to the client talk to herself
    - In a typical week, we [the developers] could have as many as 12-15 hours of meetings.
    
 4. I hate taking meeting notes.  It's a lousy job.  It's tedious.  And, few people read them anyway.  When first asked, I should have said no.  Instead, I agreed.  And, it appears that every week something goes wrong with them:  The list of recipients is missing someone, the action items are not quite correct.  And, then I have to send them again [which feels embarrassing].  And, taking notes during the conference call isn't fun, either.  But, they are  important to my client.  This task contributes to the "smallness" of this project.  It's the least enjoyable part of the week.  
 
 5. Touchdowns count for more when more people see it happen.  When 50,000 people see you score, that counts for more than when 3 people see you score.  This is a small project.  So, the wins are small.  The work does not feel meaningful.
