Lessons of Contract 3
---------------------
I was only one this contract for a short period (2 months in 2016).

But, there are lessons in this one:

 1. Before you join a project, make sure the project has real customers
    - This project built something without having requirements or customers in the hope
      of productizing it
      
 2. Be wary of clients who use lots of buzzwords
    - The client would use references to "own this space" a lot and it never made sense to me
    
 3. Be ware of clients who hold lots of meetings 
    - The client would love to have meetings face-to-face and conf calls
    - Most of the meetings were about listening to the client talk to herself
    - In a typical week, we [the developers] could have as many as 12-15 hours of meetings.
    
 4. I hate taking meeting notes.  It's a lousy job.  It's tedious.  And, few people read them anyway.  But, they were very important to my client.  I can honestly say that this is the one of the worst parts of this job.
