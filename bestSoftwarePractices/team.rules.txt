Team Environment
----------------

Rules
 1) We help each other out
    -- If someone needs help, the correct response is, "Yes." or "Give me N minutes to finish this thought and then I'll help you."
    -- No one is too busy
    
 2) Never lie
    -- If you lie, I will fire you

 3) Respect the timesheet  (it can get you fired or thrown in jail)
    -- Never lie about your hours:  You will get fired for it and prosecuted as well
	-- Simple Contract:  If you report your hours on time, then the company will pay you on time.
    -- More people have been fired for timesheet fraud than incompetence
    -- If you're not sure or you need to make-up some hours *TALK* to me and we'll figure something out

 4) Never quit
    -- You are expected to figure things out. 
	-- You are expected to solve things
  	-- Don't take it too far:  Don't hit your head against a wall for 3 days before asking for help

 5) Save surprises for birthdays
 	-- If you're going to be late or if you're blocked, let me know
	-- We have options half way through the sprint
	-- We have no options on the last day of the sprint

 6) If you need tech, use your annual $3400 to buy it
	-- This includes home office purchases

 7) Never insult the client
	-- You spend years building a reputation with a client
	-- You can shred that reputation in seconds

 8) Personal disabilities

 9) If you see something that's concerning, raise it up
	-- It may be a misunderstanding
	-- As someone with a clearance, I have an **obligation** to report things that are not right
	-- If I learned that the contract was illegally billing the client, I would **HAVE** to report it (resulting in the loss of jobs)

10) If you're working on a task, make sure there is a JIRA ticket for it 
	-- I want you to credit for your work
	-- The clients have access to the JIRA board (it helps them to know what we are working on)

11) If you think I am doing something stupid or foolish, let me know
	-- I probably don't realize it



Preferences
-----------
 1) Turn on your camera in Teams
	-- let your teammates see you (it's important)
