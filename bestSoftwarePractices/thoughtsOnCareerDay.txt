Thoughts on career day
----------------------

What happened:
 A) I got gaming mice and gaming keyboards as prizes
 B) I demonstrated the usb missile launcher
 C) No power points slides
 D) Four envelope exercise:  Each envelope had a 1, 5, 50, or 100.  Which one has the $100? 
    Rules:
     1) You cannot touch the envelopes
     2) You can add questions

    In general, most classes figured it out within 5-10 minutes
    But someone would say, "That's cheating"

 E) Talk about assumptions
    Students assumed that there was real money in there (because they saw me with a $100)
    I assumed that the slow-rest-endpoint check was needed (when it wasn't)
    Good engineer asks questions
    Good engineer makes few assumptions

 
Thoughts
--------
 1. First class was rushed (only 20 minutes).  No prizes were given out
 2. Second class was enthusaistic (gave out prizes to everyone)

 3. The kids liked the prizes (especially the gaming keyboards)
    Sam heard lots of people say, "It's not fair or Thank you"

 4. Lots of questions and answers

 
Good Engineer is...
-------------------
 A) Lazy.  We don't reinvent the wheel
 B) Never Quits
 C) Keeps learning



Thoughts for next year
----------------------
 1. Kids like prizes:  Lots of smaller prizes.  Fewer big prizes
 2. Kids understood the openCV (open computer vision library)
 3.
