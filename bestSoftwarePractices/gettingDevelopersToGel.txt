Getting Developers to Gel
-------------------------
There's no magic formula or otherwise everyone would use it.  
But, sometimes, it happens unexpectedly and quickly.

The team dynamics on my project have changed dramatically over the last few months:
 -- Change #1:  In March 2019, we got our flagship product deployed (so the pressure if off)
 -- Change #2:  Two sharp full-stack programmers left the project [which had me down in May 2019].
                One got her clearance so she could earn more
                One wanted to move on after a year [did not like management practices/poor planning -- and I understand completely]
 -- Change #3:  My project manager agreed let me teach the front-end programmers some of the back-end techniques 
                I have been surprised by forceful my PM has been been in making sure the teaching continues
 -- Change #4:  In May/June, I have been teaching 2 of the front-end programmers back-end java techniques
 -- Change #5:  In June, We got a new team lead
 -- Change #6:  In July, I have been peer-programming with the other 3 programmers [which has been quite successful]
 -- Change #7:  In July/August, I have been teaching 3 of the programmers back-end java techniques

   
Of the 7 programmers, 6 work on the same project.  I'm not sure why.  But, 3 of the developers (that I have been teaching) and I are beginning to gel.  
The 4 of us have a really good working relationship:
-- We have been peer programming tasks (that has been a big hit with these programmers)
-- We help each other out
-- We talk to each other
-- We joke with each other
-- We work side-by-side to resolve things -- and that's a great thing.
-- One of the 4 told me that he actually looks forward to getting in to work in the morning (high praise!)

My guess is that the 4 of us will become the nucleus of a new development team.  

I look forward to the fall of 2019.
