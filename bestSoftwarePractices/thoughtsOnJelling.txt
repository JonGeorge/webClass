Thoughts on "Jelling"
---------------------
How do we get developers to jel?  Teams that jel are incredibly productive.

Tom DeMcaro and Tim Lister attempted to answer this question.  They did not come up with an answer.


Teamicide
---------
These are ideas that *prevent* teams from jelling
 1. Defensive Management -- e.g., management does not trust its people.  
    -- People who feel untrusted have little inclination to obnd together into a cooperative team
 
 2. Bureaucracy -- e.g., mindless paper pushing
    -- The team needs to believe in some goal
    -- That goal can be arbitary, but it must exists
    -- There has to be some evidence that management believes in it, too.
    
 3. Physical Separation
    -- Putting the team together tgives them the opportunity for the casual interaction 
       that is necessary for team formation
       
 4. Fragementation of time -- e.g., people working on multiple projects
    -- No one can be part of multiple jelled teams.
    -- The tight interactions of the jelled team are exclusive
    
 5. The quality-reduced product -- e.g., delivering lower-quality products to get it out now
    -- Delivering low-quality products can be painful for developers.
    -- Developers self-asseem and enjoyment are undermined
    -- Co-developers building a shoddy product do'nt even want to look each other in the eye
       At the end of the project, they'll make every effort to separate themsleves from
       other members of the project
       
 6. Phony Deadlines
    -- In the typical arragenemtn, the manager announced that the work must be done on a certain date.
       The date mentioned is impossible to meet and everyone know it.
       The effor twill certainly slip
       The work has been defined in such a way that success is impossible.
       The messsage to workers is clear:  The boss believes that they won't do any work ecxept under durress.
       
 7. Team separation at the end of a project
    -- Teams cannot jel when they are separated at the end
