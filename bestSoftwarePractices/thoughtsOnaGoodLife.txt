Thoughts for a Good Life
------------------------

 1. Replace negative addiction (drugs, alcohol) with a positive addiction (books).
 
 2. Know that non situation laste forever.  Nothing is constant.
 
 3. Appreciate things that everyone shares -- e.g., sunrise.
    "Seeing the sun rise was always healing for me.  It was a new day and it was a beauty to behold."
