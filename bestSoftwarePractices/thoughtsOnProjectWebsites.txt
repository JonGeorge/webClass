Thoughts on Project Websites
----------------------------
I find that many project managers feel that having a project website (in a wiki or confluence) provides value in terms of branding.  

But, the dirty secret of these sites have hidden costs:
 1) Maintaining these sites takes time (and thus money).
 2) If you do not maintain the site, then the project site becomes worthless [as users quickly realize that it is out of date]
 3) The whole exercise creates additional work for the team
 4) If the website is open to the public, then you might not want to put info on it [thus reducing the value]
 5) If the website requires an account, then it's another hurdle for your users to get info

The costs are substantial.  The benefits of your project do not come from marketing.  The benefits come from the value of the project itself.  
If you feel that you must have a project website, then perhaps the value of your project is small.
 

Better idea:  Store your documentation in a source code repository.
