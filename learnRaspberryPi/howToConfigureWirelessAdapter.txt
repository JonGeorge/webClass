How to Configure a Wireless Adapter
-----------------------------------


Assumptions:
 A) You have a Raspberry Pi
 B) You have attached a USB wireless adapter
 C) You want to use it to connect to an existing WIFI network
 

Procedure
---------
 1. Attach your USB wireless adapter to Raspberry Pi
 
 
 2. Startup Raspberry Pi
 
 
 3. Verify that your wireless adapter is found:
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> ifconfig -a
    
    -- You should see wlan0 and information about your wireless adapter
       NOTE:  You will not see an Internet address (yet)
    
    NOTE:
    If you do not see wlan0, then 
      a. Disconnect and re-connect your USB wireless adapter into a different socket
      b. Reboot your raspberry pi 
         unix> sudo reboot
      
      
 4. Tell Raspberry Pi which wireless network to connect to 
    NOTE:  We need to add the network SSID and password to the wpa_supplicant.conf file
    
    unix> sudo -s                                             # change over as root
    unix> cd /etc/wpa_supplicant
    unix> cp wpa_supplicant.conf wpa_supplicant.conf.ORIG     # make a backup of this file
    unix> vi wpa_supplicant.conf
    
    # Add this section to the end of the file
    network={
        ssid="<name of your wireless network to connect to>"
        psk="<enter your wireless network password>"
    }
    
    
    For example, 
      if your wireless network was called myhousenet and the password was secret
      Then, you would add this:
      
      network={
         ssid="myhousenet"
         psk="secret"
      }
    
    
 5. Reboot your Raspberry Pi
    unix> sudo reboot
    
    
 
 6. Verify that you can connect to the internet
    unix> sudo ping google.com -c 5
    
    You should see this:
      64 bytes from 216.58.217.174....
      64 bytes from 216.58.217.174....
      
      5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, ...
      
      
 7. Open the web browser
    unix> x-www-browser www.googlg.eomc
    
    *or*
    
    Click the Earth symbol next to the menu to open a browser
    Type-in www.google.com
    
    You should see the Google main page
