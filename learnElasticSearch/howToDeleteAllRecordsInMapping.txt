How to Delete All Records in a Mapping (without destroying the mapping)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


POST http://localhost:9200/index/type/_delete_by_query
{
    "query": { 
        "match_all": {}
    }
}



If you had an ES mapping called "reports" with a type of "record", then it ould be this:

  POST  /reports/record/_delete_by_query
  {
      "query": { 
          "match_all": {}
      }
  }
