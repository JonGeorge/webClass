How to setup Free Role-Based Security with ElasticSearch 7.7
------------------------------------------------------------
+ Available for free starting with ES 6.8


Assumptions
 A) You have ElasticSearch 7.7 installed
    NOTE:  On Centos Linux, it would be installed to here:  /usr/share/elasticsearch 

 B) You have Kibana 7.7 installed
    NOTE:  On Centos Linux, it would be installed to here:  /usr/share/kibana

Procedure
---------
 1. Configure ElasticSearch to turn on xpack security and TLS
    NOTE:  This requires that xpack.security.transport.ssl is enabled

    a. Create the certificate
       unix> /usr/share/elasticsearch 
       unix> sudo  bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert -out config/elastic-certificates.p12 -pass ""

       Directory /usr/share/elasticsearch/config does not exist. Do you want to create it?   Y
    
       -- This should have created the certificates here:
               /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elastic-certificates.p12

   b. Copy the file to the /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificate.p12
      unix> sudo cp /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elastic-certificates.p12  /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificate.p12
 
   c. Grant permissions so your service can see the file
      unix> sudo chmod ugo+rw  /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificate.p12
      unix> sudo chmod ugo+x /etc/elasticsearch



2. Edit your ElasticSearch yml file by turning on security and setting the p12 certificate path
   unix> sudo vi /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

	# Turn on basic xpack security
	xpack.security.enabled: true
	xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
	xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
	xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificate.p12
	xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificate.p12



3. Restart your elasticsearch service
   unix> sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch


4. Verify that security is set to basic
   unix> sudo tail -2000f /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log

   You should see the line that says "Security is enabled"

1. Install ES   
   a. In the elasticsearch.yaml
        xpack.security.enabled: true


2. Install Kibana
