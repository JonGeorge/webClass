How to Delete All Records in an Index
-------------------------------------

Procedure
---------
 1. Get all indexes
    GET /_all/_mapping
    

 2. Get the statistics about this index
    GET /user_db/_stats
    
    
 3. From one of those indexes, look at some data
    NOTE:  We need to know the *_type* field
    GET /user_db/_search?size=<BIG_NUMBER>
    
    
 4. Delete all records from this index, of this type
    NOTE:  I assume the _type of all records is "event"
    DELETE /user_db/event
