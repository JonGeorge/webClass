 3. Configure kibana so that it has the correct ElasticSearch port
    NOTE:  I assume that your  ElasticSearch is listening on port 9201
    a. Edit c:\tools\kibana-5.4.0-windows-x86\config\kibana.yml

    b. Change this line:
         #elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9200"

       To this:
         elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9201"

    c. Save your changes


 4. Startup Kibana manually
    a. Open a DOS window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
       CMD> cd /d c:\tools\kibana-5.4.0-windows-x86\bin
       CMD> kibana.bat

       You should see this:
       {"name":"Kibana","hostname":"Ronda","pid":2340,"level":30,"msg":"No existing kibana index found","time":"2016-02-26T19:11:03.701Z","v":0}
       {"name":"Kibana","hostname":"Ronda","pid":2340,"level":30,"msg":"Listening on 0.0.0.0:5601","time":"2016-02-26T19:11:03.719Z","v":0}
         -- Now, kibana is listening on port 5601

    b. Now stop it by pressing Control-C


 5. Create a Windows Service to startup Kibana
    a. Open a CMD window in Administrator mode
    b. Search for cmd
       Right-click on Command Prompt -> Run as Administrator

       DOS> sc create "Kibana 5.4.0" binPath= "C:\tools\kibana-5.4.0-windows-x86\bin\kibana.bat" depend= "elasticsearch-service-x64"


 6. Start your Kibana service using services.msc
    a. Run the Services app
    b. Look for Kibana
    c. Right-click on Kibana -> Start
       NOTE:  The sc command *DOES* create a Windows Service
              When you attempt to start the service, you will get an error saying it did not start in a timely fashion
              -- But, Kibana is actually up!!
