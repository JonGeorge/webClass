Lesson:  Elastic Search Analyzers
---------------------------------

Built-in full-text analyzers
 1) Standard analyzer 
    The standard analyzer is the default analyzer that Elasticsearch uses. 
    + It is the best general choice for analyzing text that may be in any language. 
    + It splits the text on word boundaries, as defined by the Unicode Consortium, 
    + It removes most punctuation. 
    + It lowercases all terms. It

 2) Simple analyzer
    + It splits text on anything that isnâ€™t a letter, 
    + It lowercases the terms.
 
 3) Whitespace analyzer 
    + It splits the text on whitespace only
     
     
Important Points
----------------
 A) When you query a full-text field, the query will apply the same analyzer to the query string  
    to produce the correct list of terms to search for.

 B) When you query an exact-value field, the query will not analyze the query string.
    Instead, it searcesh for the exact value that you have specified. 

 C) The _all field is a full-text field
    
 D) When Elasticsearch detects a new string field in your documents,
    it automatically configures it as a full-text string field and analyzes it with the standard analyzer.
    
    
Testing an analyzer
-------------------
GET /_analyze?analyzer=standard
{
    "text" :"Text to analyze"
}
