Lesson:  Your Aggregate Queries are Slow When min_doc_count=0
-------------------------------------------------------------
I spent 3 days trying to figure out why my searches were running slowly.  
Was it the front-end angular pages?
Was it the back-end Java ElasticSearch DAO Service class?

After narrowing down the commit that caused the problem, we found the issue:
 -- There was a min_doc_count=0 in the aggregate query sent to ElasticSearch
    When min_doc_count=0               --> SLOW searches
    When min_doc_count=0 or not present -> FAST searches
    
Why was min_doc_count set to zero?
 -- This aggregate was run to display filters on the web page
 -- The developer did not want "holes" in the date aggregates
 -- So, the developer set min_doc_count=0
 
In our development environment, we saw no problems
In our pre-prod environment, searches took 45-to-90 seconds!

When we removed the min_doc_count=0 from the aggregate, searches took less than 1 second.
