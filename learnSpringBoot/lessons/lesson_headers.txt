Lesson:  Headers used by REST calls
-----------------------------------

Content-Type: application/json
  -- Tells the receipient that the content-type of my payload is application/json
  -- If there is no payload, then you do not need to use this header

Accept: application/json
  -- Tells the recipient that I want the response as application/json
