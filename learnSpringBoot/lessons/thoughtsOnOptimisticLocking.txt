Thoughts on Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking
---------------------------------------------
Will you let multiple users edit the *same* record?
If so, how?
 1. Optimistic Locking -- any user can update the record.  
    Problem:  Will person B overwrite person A's changes every time?  
              Will you pass-in a version field and let the user know that person B is overwriting person A's changes?

 2. Pessmisitc Locking -- one user has the record locked.  No one can make changes while it's locked




If you are going to allow multiple users to edit the same record
 1. Make sure your database table has a version column [that's a number]
 2. Make sure your updates *pass-in* the version column
 3. Make sure your controller checks that the version value == the version value for this record in the database

    If the version values match, then proceed with update SQL transaction

    If the version values do not match, then Problem






What do you do when the version values do not match?
----------------------------------------------------
Possible Approaches:
 A) Put-up a popup message saying that John Smith updated this record and you should reload your page
    - That sucks!  I lost all of my changes
    + I know who made changes

 B) Have a background process on the front-end check if the fields are updated and provide contact info of who changed it?
    -- This is more work on the front-end

 C) Attempt to merge your changes with the latest changes
    -- This is hard to do: 
         Suppose user A made changes at 12:00 
         Suppose user B made changes at 12:05
         Suppose user C made changes at 12:10
         You press the save button at 12:15
         -- What is truth?  
         -- You have to compare your changes from 12:10 to 12:15
         -- How do you resolve them?     


 D) Create a soft lock -- a visual lock button on the page 
    -- Only user A can edit the page
    -- If user B visits the page, then user B sees that user A has the file locked
    -- Problem:  When is the lock released?
                 -- Does it get released when user A logs out or session expires?
                 -- Does it get released when User A clicks to release lock?  [this could be weeks later]
             
    -- In general, users do not like being locked-out of records.  That sucks!
