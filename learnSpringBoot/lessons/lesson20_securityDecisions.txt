Lesson:  Security Design & Decisions
------------------------------------


Decisions that must be answered
-------------------------------
 A. What will be protected in addition to REST calls?
    a. Will all JavaScript, HTML, and images be protected?
    b. Will custom JavaScript be protected?
    c. Will node_modules directory be protected?
    d. Will all JavaScript, HTML, and CSS be un-protected?
       + Simple
       + Faster than other approaches (as there is less encryption/decryption)
       + The JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is visible to the user anyway
        NOTE:  TD Ameritrade does not protect JavaScript as it is already public.  You cannot stop a user from seeing it.
               So, they do not secure it


 B. How will security be implemented?
    Will security be implemented in the code or outside of the code?

    a. External implementation:  Setup an authorization filter and have it query roles and role-to-rest-calls on startup
       + Security is outside of REST calls
       - More complex
       - Developers may forget as it is not visible in code


    b. Internal implementation:  Use if statements in controller REST calls
       + Simple
       + Developer will not forget as it is visible in code
       + Business rules are hard-coded in REST calls

    c. Internal implementation:  Use @PreAuthorize annotations above controller REST calls
       + Simple
       + Developer will not forget as it is visible in code
