Fundamentals: Four Variable Locations
-------------------------------------
In any Java class, variables are found in 4 places:
 1) Local varaibles -- within methods.  These are always threadsafe.  They are your friends.
 2) method parameters -- passed-in to methods or constructors
 3) instance variables -- one exists within each instance of a class
 4) class (or static) variables -- these variables are shared among every instance




public class Stuff
 {
    // Example of a static variable that is shared among all class instances)
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactor.getLogger(Stuff.class);


    // Example of an instance variable -- each instance has its own reference
    private DataSource dataSource;


    public void doSomething(String aText) {
      // Example of a local variable
      String localVar = "hi";

    }
 }
