 B) You have Maven installed


Marshalling vs Serialization
----------------------------
 Marshaling:      Converting data to a byte-stream 
                  Marshalling means bundling up parameters for a remote method call. Under RMI, marshalling uses serialization. 

 Serialization:   Converting java objects into byestream.
                  Converting java objects to sequences of bits that can be transported to a different VM. 
                  

 Marshalling and serializing are loosly synonymous in the context of remote procedure calls.

 Serialization:  When you serialize an object, only the member data within that object is written to the byte stream; not the code that actually implements the object
 Marshalling:    Means to records its state and codebase in such a way that when it is "unmarshalled", a copy of the original object is obtained.
                 You can marshall any object that is serializable
                   
 
 Marshalling refers to converting the signature and parameters of a function into a single byte array
 Serialization more often refers to converting an entire object / object tree into a byte array
