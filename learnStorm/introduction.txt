A Storm cluster is superficially similar to a Hadoop Cluster:
  -- On a Hadoop Cluster you run MapReduce jobs.  And, the MapReduce jobs eventually finish.
  -- On a Storm cluster, you run Toplogies.  Topologies process message forever (or until you kill it)
  
  
A Storm cluster has 2 kinds of nodes:
 1) Master Node:  Runs a daemon called "Nimbus" that is similar to Hadoop's JobTracker.  
                  It distributes code around the cluster
                  It assigns tasks to machines
                  It monitors for failures
                  
 2) Worker Nodes: Runs a daemon called "Supervisor".
                  Listens for work assigned to its machine
                  Starts & Stops work perocesses as necessary
                  Each worker process executes a subset of a toplogy
                  A running topology consists of many worker processes spread cross many machines

All coordinates between Nimbus and the Supervisors is done through a Zookeeper cluster.  
-- The Nimbus and Supervisor daemons are fail-fast and stateless
-- All steps are kept in Zookeeeper or on local disk
-- You can run kill the Nimbus or Supervisors and they'll start back up as if nothing happened
-- This design leads to Storm clusters being incredibly stable

Zookeeper as you can see sits there in the middle. Since Storm is stateless, it uses Zookeeper to share and sync data between them
Nimbus hands-off work to the Supervisors [which exists to process Bolts and Spouts]

Spouts are input data.  
Bolt are output data.
Tuples (ordered sets) can contain any type of data
Topology is a directed graph where vertices are computation and edges are a stream of data"
  Spout1 --> Bolt1  --> Boltd
         --> Bolt2  --> Bolt3
  Spout2 --> Bolt1

Write a spout
Write a bolt
Make it run by writing a topology
