How to Add User Information to Logger Entry
-------------------------------------------

Problem:  You are debugging a problem in your web app 
          But, your log file does not show the name of the user that caused the problem
          -- It would be really helpful to have this user information on each line of the log file
          

Solution #1
-----------
 1) Create a filter that works on all requests
    NOTE:  The filter should have this
    
       import org.apache.log4j.MDC
    
    
       in the filter code:
          try
          {
           MDC.put("username"), getUsername() );
          }
          finally
          {
           MDC.clear()            
           }
           
           
 2) Adjust your logger to display the username
  
   pattern should have  %X{username}
