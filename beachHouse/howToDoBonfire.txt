How do to a bonfire
--------------------
1) Stuff to bring
    a) Matches or lighter (even better)
    b) wood
    c) chemical log with paper wrapper
       NOTE:  If chemical log has no paper wrapper than use lots of napkins
       
    d) chairs
    
    e) Towel (for those who want to sit on it)
    
    f) Stuff for S'mores -- e.g., Chocolate, Graham crackers, marshmellows
    
    g) 36" dowels to hold s'mores
    
    h) Glow sticks (so we can see the kids)
    
    i) Shovel (to dig initial hole)
    
    j) Something to poke the wood with
    
    
2) Watch out for mosquitoes
   -- On one year, we had tons of mosquitoes and they would not leave us alone
