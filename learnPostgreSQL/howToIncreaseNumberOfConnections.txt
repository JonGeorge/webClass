How to increase the number of postgres database connections
-----------------------------------------------------------

Rememer:  Postgres keeps 3 connections in reserve (for emergency connections)
          So, if you set it to 100, you only have 97 available for use

Assumptions: 
 A) You have a Postgres 9.5 server
 B) You have authority to change the postgres.conf file


Procedure
---------
 1. Get the breakdown of who is using connections
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> psql -U postgres

    # Get the breakdown of connection use
    psql> select usename, count(usename) from pg_stat_activity group by usename order by 2 desc;

    # Get the total number of connections in use
    psql> select count(usename) from pg_stat_activity;
    

 2. Get the current ceiling of database connections set (in the postgresql.conf file)
    unix> grep max_connections /var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf
          max_connections = 100        
            
 
 3. Increase the connection limit from 100 to 200
    unix> vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf
    
    Change this entry to this:
      max_connections = 200
      
      
 4. Restart the database instance
    unix> service postgresql-9.5 restart
