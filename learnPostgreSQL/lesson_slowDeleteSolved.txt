Lesson:  Why was my delete operation so slow?
----------------------------------------------

Approach:  Use Explain Analyze Verbose to identify what is taking the most time

In this case, I was deleting from a main table that had a few child foreign keys

One of those child foreign key constraints was taking 3 minutes!!

Solution (in the middle of the SQL transaction)
 1) Delete the foreign key constraint
 2) Delete from the main table
 3) Restore the foreign key constriant

The end result was that constraints were only down for about 40 milliseconds.

I cut the time from 3.5 minutes to 1 seconds.
