How to Increase Delete Operation in Postgres 9.5
------------------------------------------------
Problem:  Deletes are very slow


Suggestion:
  Use Explain Analyze Verbose to identify the slowest operations
  In this case, the problem was a foreign key constraint (implemented as trigger)
  which was taking 3 minutes


Solution:
 Within the SQL transaction
  1) Disable the foreign key constraint before running the delete SQL call
      ALTER TABLE child_table DROP Constraint constraint_name

  2) Run the delete SQL call
      Delete from parent_table....

  3) Restore the foreign key constraint
      ALTER TABLE child_table
      ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (c1) REFERENCES parent_table (p1);

  This improved delete performance of 10,000 rows from 3 minutes to 134 milliseconds
