Learn SQL:  How to do bulk auditing
-----------------------------------
Technique:  Use the WITH statement and RETURNING *
            + Zero records are transferred back from the network
            + You can do your insert/update/delete and audit in one call



SQL
---
 1. Construct one SQL call that will do your insert and audit operation


       WITH delete_rows AS
       (
            delete from main-table RETURNING *
       )
       INSERT INTO main-table_aud(...)
       (
           select * from deleted_rows
       )

      insert into main_table(col1, col2, col3) values(?, ?, ?) RETURNING *


       JdbcTemplate jt = new JdbcTemplate(myDataSource);
       int rowsinserted = jt.update(sql)


 2. Run your SQL

        WITH inserted_rows AS (
            insert into users(id, user_id, full_name, email_address, phone_number, last_login_date) values(5, 'psmith', 'Peter Smith', null, null, null)
            RETURNING  *
        )
        insert into users_aud(id, user_id, full_name, email_address, phone_number, rev, rev_type, timestamp, username)
            (
                select id, user_id, full_name, email_address, phone_number, 1000, 0, now(), 'BOGUS_USER'
                from inserted_rows
            );
