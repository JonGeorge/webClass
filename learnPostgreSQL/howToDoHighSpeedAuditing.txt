How to do High-Speed Auditing in Postgres
-----------------------------------------
Problem:  You want to delete 10,000 records and insert 10,000 audit records at the same time
Solution: Use the WITH....INSERT INTO....trick

Assumptions:
 A) You need to audit insert/update/delete records using a snapshots
 B) You have a separate audit table for your main table
 C) You want to quickly delete


First Approach:  Use the DELETE.... RETURNING *
-----------------------------------------------
 // Use the delete from and RETURNING * trick to delete records and get the results
 String sql = "delete from main_table....RETURNING *";
 JdbcTemplate jt = new JdbcTemplate(myDataSource);
 List<Map<>> listOfMaps = jt.update(sql);

 Loop through the list of maps, inserting audit records



Second Approach:  Use the WITH....INSERT INTO....
-------------------------------------------------
Why is it better?
 + No need to serialize, de-serialize, and transmit the info over the network
 + It's faster:  Use one query (instead of 2 queries)

 WITH rows AS (delete from main-table RETURNING *)
 INSERT INTO main-table_aud(...)
 select *



Even Better:  Create an Audit Service that does the call for you
----------------------------------------------------------------
 1) Setup a Constructor that passes-in the audit-username, and audit-datetime
 2) Make a public method that runs bulkAudit(pass-in create/update/delete sql, tablename to audit)
    a) The method queries the information-schema for all of the column names
    b) The method converts the passed-in SQL into a WITH...

 For example, you woudl call
       auditService.bulkAudit("delete from main_table where id=25 RETURNING *", "main_table")

 Executed SQL would
       WITh subquery AS (
          delete from main_table where id=25 RETURNING *
       )
       INSERT INTO main_table_aud(rev, revisiontype, username, timestamp, field1, field2, field3)
       VALUES....
       FROM subquery
