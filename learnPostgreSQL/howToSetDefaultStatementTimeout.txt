How to Set Default Statement Timeout 
------------------------------------
Problem:  Our older version of postgres had an unlimited statement_timeout value
          When we upgraded postgres, postgres had a default statement timeout of 1 minute
          -- Our transactions already had statement timeouts
          
Solution: Set the statement timeout to zero


Procedure
---------
 1. Login as your database user to your postgres database
 
 2. Within psql, run this command:
    psql=> show statement_timeout;
    
      statement_timeout 
      -------------------
      1min

          
    psql => set statement_timeout=0;
    
      statement_timeout 
      -------------------
      0
