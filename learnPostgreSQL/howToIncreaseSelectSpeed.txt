How to Increase Select Query Speed
----------------------------------
Problem:  I have a complicated view with lots of lett joins and I only need a few records
          So, postgres will generate he entire view and then filter the results
          -- This is slow
          
             select table.*
             from table
             left join (
                -- Slow query to get the oldest record from audit table
             )
             left join (
                -- Slow query to get csv of values
             )
             where table.id=<my id>
             
             
Faster Approach:  Move the here clause into the inner joins to dramatically increase spee
This method increased query time from 6 seconds to 50 milliseconds.  And, no postgresql.conf settings were changed

             select table.*
             from table
             left join (
                -- Slow query to get the oldest record from audit table
                -- where table.id=<my id>
             )
             left join (
                -- Slow query to get csv of values
                   where table.id=<my id>
             )
            
  NOTE:  Increasing the work_mem from 8MB to 64MB helped speed-up the sorting (to find the oldest/newest records)
         But, adding the where clauses to the inner joins made a much larger impact.
