How to Setup and Use a NameSpace
--------------------------------



Approach #1
------------
var yourNamespace = {

    foo: function() {
    },

    bar: function() {
    }
};

yourNamespace.foo();




Approach #2  (using the new command)
------------------------------------
var ns = new function() {

    var internalFunction = function() {

    };

    this.publicFunction = function() {

    };
};

var something = ns.publicFunction();  


Because of the "new" , what is doing is that it's declaring an anonymous function 
(and as a function, it is as well a constructor), 
and it then immediately invokes it as a constructor using new. 
As such, the final value that gets stored inside ns is a (unique) instance of that anonymous constructor.
