Lesson:  Benefits of Anaconda Python
------------------------------------
When working with Python you will want to install Python modules.


Problem:  Python Modules
-------------------------
Suppose you are building a python program to pull stuff from a website.
You will probably need the "streamparse" module.
  -- So, you run "pip install streamparse"
  -- It complains that you do not have the MS C++ Compiler
  
The problem is that some Python modules might require you to compile stuff.
And, if you are running on Windows, then you will need to download the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.



Solution:  Install the Anaconda version of Python
-------------------------------------------------
The Anaconda version of python includes Python along with 180+ frequently used modules.
By packaging Anaconda up with 180+ python modules, you get a few advantages:
 1) Instead of using pip to install lots of modules, you will mostly likely have it installed for you
 2) You can install the same version of Anaconda on your desktop and on your target server
 3) For the most part, you will not need to compile modules 
 4) You will be get some of the crypography libraries installed [which are the frequently compiled modules]
 5) Uninstalling Anaconda is simply erasing the directory where you installed them
 6) You get a handy "conda" function to list all of your modules:
    DOS> conda list 
         -- Will list all of the modules
          

So, make your life easier and install the Anaconda version of python (instead of the regular one)
