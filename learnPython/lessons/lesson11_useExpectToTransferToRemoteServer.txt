How to use pexpect to transfer files to remote servers
------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:
  A) You have this python module installed:  pexpect
  

Sample Python Script
--------------------
import pexpect

gsPassword = 'secret'

# Use the -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" so that scp does not prompt for yes/no if this is a new host
child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/scp -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" /tmp/fbi.properties  admin@192.168.90.18:/tmp')

# Optional:  Send logging to this file for debugging
# child.logfile = open("/tmp/copy.log", "w")

# This line means, "wait until you see a string that matches password:"
# in the response
print("Expecting password...")
child.expect('password:', timeout=120)

print("Sending password...")
child.sendline(gsPassword) # Send the characters pass123 and "enter"

# When the process is done, we should get an EOF 
child.expect(pexpect.EOF)
