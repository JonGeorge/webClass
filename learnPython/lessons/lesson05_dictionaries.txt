Lesson:  Working with Dictionaries
----------------------------------
A Dictionary (or "dict") is a way to store data just like a list,
but instead of using only numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything. 
This lets you treat a dict like it's a database for storing and organizing data.

Dictionaries are created with { }


Creating a Dictionary
---------------------
The following code creates a dictionary called stuff
  stuff = {	
  		'name': 'Zed', 
  		'age': 39, 
  		'height': 6 * 12 + 2
  }


Example:  Create a dictionary that maps the state name to short name
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	states = {
	    'Oregon':     'OR',
	    'Florida':    'FL',
	    'California': 'CA',
	    'New York':   'NY',
	    'Michigan':   'MI'
	}
	


Loop through all keys/values in the states dictionary
-----------------------------------------------------
for stateName, stateAbbrev in states.items():
     print("%s is abbreviated %s" % (stateName, stateAbbrev))


Loop through only the dictionary keys
-------------------------------------
 1. Fast way to loop through the dict keys:
 		for stateName in states:
		    print("stateName is %s" % stateName)

    Why is this fast?
    Answer:  Dictionaries implement a tp_iter slot that returns an efficient iterator that iterates over the keys of the dictionary. [...] This means that we can write
	         So, we are using the states.iterkeys() method


 2. Fast way to loop through the dict keys (but more obvious what is happening)
 		for stateName in states.iterkeys():
		    print("stateName is %s" % stateName)


 3. Another way to loop through the dict keys (but not as fast)
 		for stateName in states.keys():
	   		print("stateName is %s" % stateName)
	   		
	  
	   		
Loop through only the dictionary values
---------------------------------------
 1. Fast way to loop through the dict values
 		for stateAbbrev in states.itervalues():
		    print("stateAbbrev is %s" % stateAbbrev)

 2. Not as fast way to loop through the dict values
    NOTE:  We are looping through the keys and pulling the value out
 		for stateName in states.iterkeys():
		    print("stateAbbrev is %s" % states[stateName])
