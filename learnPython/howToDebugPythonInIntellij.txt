How to Debug Python Script using IntelliJ
-----------------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You have Intellij Ultimate already installed
 
 
Procedure
---------
 1. Startup Intellij
    NOTE:  If an existing project opens, then pull File / Close Project
 
 
 2. Install the Python module 
    In the Intellij Page, pull Configure -> Plugins
    
    Press "Browse repositories...."
    
    In the searchbox, type-in python
    
    Single-click on "Python"

           Press "Yes"
           
    
 3. Press "Create New Project"
    a. In the "New Project", 
          Click on "Python" [on the left]
       
       Next to Project SDK, press "New..." -> Add Local....
         Browse to your Python Interpeter:  C:\tools\Python35-32\python.exe
         Press OK
       
       Now, Project SDK: says "Python 3.5.1
       
       Press "Next"
       
    b. In the next screen,
       Uncheck "Create project from template"
       Press "Next"
   
    c. In the next screen
       Project name:      pythonStuff
       Project location:  C:\tools\intellij\workspace\pythonStuff
       Pres "Finish"
  
  
  4. Create a small Python script
     a. Right-click on pythonStuff -> New Python File
     b. In the popup
        Name:  intro.py
        Press OK
    
     c. Copy this to intro.py
        import math
        
        print("The value of PI is approximately" ,  math.pi)
        
        print("The value of PI is approximately %f " % (math.pi) )   
      
      
        
  5. Verify that you can run the Python script
     a. Right-click on intro.py -> Run 'intro'
       
        C:\tools\Python35-32\python.exe C:/tools/intellij/workspace/pythonStuff/intro.py
        The value of PI is approximately 3.141592653589793
        The value of PI is approximately 3.141593 
  
  
  6. Verify that you can debug the Python script
     a. Add a breakpoint on the 1st print statement by clicking in the margin
     b. Right-click on intro.py -> Debug 'intro'
        -- You should have reached your breakpoint
