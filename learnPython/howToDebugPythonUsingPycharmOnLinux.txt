 B) You have already installed Python installed  [see howToInstallPython.txt]
 
 
Procedures
----------
 1. Download PyCharm Community Edition 5.0.4

        e) Press Apply
        
     f. Press OK
    
    

  5. Create a small Python script and attempt to debug it
     d. In the main screen, press "Create New Project"
     
     e. In the next screen
        Location:     /home/adam/PycharmProjects/proj1
        Interpreter:  (should hold the path of your Python)
        Press "Create"
     
     f. Right-click on project1 -> New Python File
        Name:  intro.py
     
     g. Copy this to your intro.py
        WARNING:  Make sure there are no indentations or spaces 
        
            import math
                
            print("The value of PI is approximately" ,  math.pi)
            
            print("The value of PI is approximately %f " % (math.pi) )   
     
    

   6. Attempt to run your intro.py script
      a. Right-click on intro.py -> Run 'intro'

      You should see this in the console:
        (The value of PI is approximately 3.141592653589793)
        The value of PI is approximately 3.141593 
        

   
   
   7. Attempt to debug your intro.py script
      a. Set a breakpoint by clicking in the margin on the first print statement
      b. Right-click on intro.py -> Debug 'intro'
      
      
      You should reach your breakpoint
      Press F9 to continue
      
      You should see this in the console:
        The value of PI is approximately 3.141592653589793
        The value of PI is approximately 3.141593
