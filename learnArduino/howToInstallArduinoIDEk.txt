How to Install the Arduino IDE for Windows 7
--------------------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You have an Arduino board
 B) You want to install the Arduino IDE
 C) You want to download the driver so that Windows 7 can upload to the Arduino board
 
 
Procedures
----------
 1. Download & Install the Arduino IDE
    a. Download the Arduino IDE
       1) Go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
       2) Click on "Windows installer"
          *OR*
          Go to https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.8-windows.exe
          
       3) Save arduino-1.6.8-windows.exe to your c:\vault\
 
    b. Install the Arduino IDE
       1) Run c:\vault\arduino-1.6.8-windows.exe
       2) In the "License Agreement" screen, press "I Agree"
       3) In the "Installation Options" screen, select all options and press "Next"
       4) In the "Installation Folder" screen, go with the default of
             C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino
          Press "Install"     
       5) If prompted, "Would you like to install this device software?"
          Press "Install"
       6) Press the "Close" button to close the installer
    
                  
           
 2. Configure the Arduino driver for Windows
    a. Connect your Arduino device to your PC with the USB cable
       NOTE:  You should see some lights light-up on your Arduino board
    
    b. Open the Windows Device Manager
       a. Right-click on Arduino Uno  (probably under "Ports")
          Select Update Driver Software
       
       b. Select "Browse my computer for driver software"  
       c. Browse to the "drivers" folder under where Arduino was installed
            C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\drivers
            Press OK
            Press Next
     
                  
           
 3. Tell the Arduino IDE where the board is connected and what type of board it is
    a. Startup Arduino IDE
    
    b. Tell the Arduino IDE which typoe of socket the Arduino is connected to 
       Pull Tools -> Port -> Select the COM port number that appear in the previous step
    
    c. Tell the Arduino IDE which board is connected
       Pull Tools -> Board -> Arduino UNO   
 


 4. Verify it works by running a simple LED blink script 
    a. In the Arduino IDE, pull / File -> New
    b. Copy this to your project space:
    
        void setup()
        {
          // put your setup code here, to run once:
          pinMode(13, OUTPUT);  // set digital pin 13 to output
        }
        
        void loop()
        {
          // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
          delay(500);
        
          digitalWrite(13, LOW);
          delay(500);
        }
        
    c. Pull Sketch / Verify
    d. Pull Sketch / Upload
       -- You shoul see a flashing LED
