Samuel's Congratulatory Remarks

Samuel Resnick:  You did it.  You are a "Bar Mitzvah"

Bar means son
Mitzvah means commandment.  But, I think in this case, means subject to commandemnts.
You are subject to commandments.
In order words:  
 -- You are now responsible for your actions.  
 -- You are responsible for your sins.  


I'd like to say that life gets simpler.  But, it doesn't.  It gets more complex. You'll find more shades of grey.
But, you have a number of things going for you:
 1) Look around -- we (your family) are on your side.  We have your back.
 2) You're strong & selfless
 3) You don't need to follow the crowd
 4) Most all of all:  You're a good person.

We love you.
We're so very proud of you.
And, we think highly of you.

Congratulations, Samuel.
