How to Set MySql Transaction Level
----------------------------------

When you startup MySql Workbench, by default, you are not in READ-COMMITTED mode

Transaction Modes
-----------------
READ COMMITTED      At this isolation level, only committed rows can be seen by a transaction.   Furthermore, any changes committed after a statement commences execution cannot be seen. For example, if you have a long-running SELECT statement in session A that queries from the BOOKS table, and session B inserts a row into BOOKS while A's query is still running, that new row will not be visible to the SELECT.
REPEATABLE READ     At this isolation level, no changes to the database that are made by other sessions since the transaction commenced can be seen within the transaction, until the transaction is committed or rolled back (cancelled). This means that if you re-execute a SELECT within your transaction, it will always show the same results (other than any updates that occurred in the same transaction).
SERIALIZABLE        At this isolation level, every transaction is completely isolated so that transactions behave as if they had executed serially, one after the other. In order to achieve this, the RDBMS will typically lock every row that is read, so other sessions may not modify that data until the transaction is done with it. The locks are released when you commit or cancel the transaction.
