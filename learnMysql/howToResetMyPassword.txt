How to Reset the MySql Password
-------------------------------
If you have lost or need to reset the root password to 'MyNewPassword', follow these steps:

ASSUMPTIONS:
 a) You have mysql installed to here:
    C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6
    
    

1. Stop the MySql Server (if it is running)
    
2. Create a text file with the SQL to reset the root password
    a) Create a test file called c:\temp\mysql_init.sql   [it can be any name you want]
    b) Within this text file, copy this text:
    
       SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPassword');
        
        
3. Have MySql Execute this file
    a) Open a console window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
       NOTE:  Open the DOS window as an administrator
       
    b) In the DOS window, type in these commands:
        DOS> cd /d "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin"
        DOS> mysqld.exe --init-file=c:\temp\mysql_init.sql  
        
        Now, mysql is running and you have changed the password
        
        
 
4. Login into MySql with the new password
    a) Open a *new* conosle window by pressing <Start><Run>CMD
     
    b) In the DOS window, try to login
        DOS> cd /d "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin"
        DOS> mysql -uroot -h127.0.0.1 -pMyNewPassword
            -- Make any changes you need to make as root
            
            
5. Stop the mysql server running in that console window
    a) Open the task manager
    b) Kill the mysqld.exe process
    
    
6. Now, startup the mysql service


And, you have successfully reset the root password without knowing the old password
