How to Setup Intellij to Run Hadoop Job
---------------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You have Intellij Commnity Edition 14 installed
 B) You have a Java JDK
 

Procedures
----------
1) Download hadoop-core-0.20.2 to your c:\tools

2) If your hadoop job needs to reach mysql, then copy mysql-connector-java to your <HADOOP_HOME>/lib

3) Configure Hadoop 
    a) Modify c:\tools\hadoop\conf\hadoop-env.sh
       set JAVA_HOME = to where your java homje is
       set HADOOP_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005
       
       When running hadoop from command-line, it will be in debug mode, listening on port 5005
       

4) In Intellij, exclude build directory
   a) Pull File / Settings
   b) Search for maven
      Importing -> Uncheck exclude build directory
      
      
5) Build your code -- create java jar


6) Configure hadoop classpath
   a) export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=...path/where/logback.xml is located
   
7) Create a logback.xml file in the HADOOP_CLASSPATH

8) Run your hadoop java jar in debug mode
   a. Add Hadoop/bin to your PATH
   b. hadoop jar ./target/my-jar  my.class.Name  my arguments
   
      You should see Listening for transport dt_socket at address 5005
      
      
9) Use Intellij to connect to it remotely
