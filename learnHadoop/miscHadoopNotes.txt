Misc Hadoop Notes
-----------------
1) When creating your Hadoop Map/Reduce Job, be aware of the class path
   For example, hadoop comes with the apache commons codec jar in the hadoop/lib directory
   -- If you use a newer version of codec in your project, Hadoop will ignore it
   -- By default, the hadoop/lib gets higher precedence in the classpath
   
  
  To find out the JAR you are actually using at **run time**, try running this code:
    final URL loc = MyClass.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation();
    System.out.println("Found jar file for Myclass at ", loc);
